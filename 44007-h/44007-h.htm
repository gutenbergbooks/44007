<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you please state your name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. 512 North Lancaster, apartment 102.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What city and state?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you born in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Born in Miami, Okla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In Oklahoma?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you move to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. About 2 years after I was born. My father was foreman on a
construction company and we moved to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go to school in Texas, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I went first year in Lockhart. The second year we moved to
Houston, for a year, and we moved back to Lockhart, and I went there 10 years in
Lockhart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You graduated from high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to school after you graduated from high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I went to Southwest Texas State Teachers College in San Marcos
a year, and a year in Nixon Clay Business College in Austin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I got married and quit school and went to work for Hardy's
Shoe Store. I&mdash;that was in September, and I got married in December. And I
have been with them ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you go to work for Hardy's Shoe Store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. In September of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do they assign you to any particular store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I worked at the Capital Plaza Shopping Center in Austin for
about 10 months, and then they transferred me to Dallas and gave me a store
down on Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In Austin were you just a shoe salesman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was assistant manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And they transferred you to a shop on Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the address of that shop in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. 213 West Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They made you the manager of that shop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you been manager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Since August of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>.  From August 1962 on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Until the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Until the day I was made manager of the downtown store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Today is the 2d of April, or the 3d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were made manager of the Hardy's Downtown Shoe Store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.
It wasn't April Fool's. I thought they were firing me, but it turned out they weren't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he call you in yesterday to tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Day before yesterday and told me to get ready for an audit, that
I would be going to town, if I wanted it, and I said yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this be considered a promotion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. A better store, more volume, and make more money. It would
be considered a promotion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any children at all, Mr. Brewer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to take you back to November 22, 1963. This was the day
that President Kennedy was assassinated. How did you find out about the
assassination, Mr. Brewer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. We were listening to a transistor radio there in the store, just
listening to a regular radio program, and they broke in with the bulletin that
the President had been shot. And from then, that is all there was. We listened
to all of the events.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear over the radio that the President had died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I heard a rumor. They said that&mdash;one of the Secret Service men
said that the President had died, and said that was just a rumor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember hearing anything else over the radio concerning
anything that happened that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, they kept reconstructing what had happened and what
they had heard, and they talked about it in general. There wasn't too much
to talk about. They didn't have all the facts, and just repeated them mostly.
And they said a patrolman had been shot in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is Oak Cliff the area in which your shoe store was located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, would you describe what happened after you heard
on the radio that an officer had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, there was heard a siren coming down East Jefferson headed
toward West Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the dividing street between East and West Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far is Beckley from your store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Two blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Two blocks to the east or to the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. There is Zangs to the east. The first street is Zangs and the
next street is Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The first street east is Zangs Boulevard and the next street is
Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is your store located to the north or south side of Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. On the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I looked up and out towards the street and the police <span class="locked">cars&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you looked up, did you step out of the store at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No; I was still in the store behind the counter, and I looked
up and saw the man enter the lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say the lobby of your store, first let me ask you to
describe how is&mdash;how wide is your store, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. About 20 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, is the entrance to your store right on the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. The entrance to the store is about 15 feet from the sidewalk,
front doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The front doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes; they are recessed, and then there is windows, show
windows on each side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This would be, if we were&mdash;if we would take a look at the letter
"U," or see the letter "V," your doorway would be at the bottom part of the
letter and the show cases would be at the sides of the letter, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What you call this lobby, that is the area between the sidewalk
and your front door, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you saw a man going into what you referred to as
this lobby area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes; and he stood there with his back to the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did he go in now? What did you hear at the time that he
stepped into this lobby area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I heard the police cars coming up Jefferson, and he stepped in,
and the police made a U-turn and went back down East Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did he make the U-turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. At Zangs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the sirens going away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes; the sirens were going away. I presume back to where
the officer had been shot, because it was back down that way. And when they
turned and left, Oswald looked over his shoulder and turned around and walked
up West Jefferson towards the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me hold you a minute. You used the word Oswald. Did you
know who the man was at the time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So at the time, you didn't know what his name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you describe the man you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He was a little man, about 5'9", and weighed about 150 pounds
is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How tall are you, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Six three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you say he was about 5'9"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. About 5'9".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And about 150?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. And had brown hair. He had a brown sports shirt on. His
shirt tail was out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color of trousers, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Light or dark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't remember that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any other clothing that you noticed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He had a T-shirt underneath his shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was his shirt buttoned up all the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. A couple of buttons were unbuttoned at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Light complexioned or dark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Light complexioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. After you saw him in the lobby of your store there,
what you call a lobby area, which is really kind of an extension of the sidewalk,
then you saw him leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, he turned and walked up <span class="locked">toward&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had the police sirens subsided at the time he turned, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No; you could still hear sirens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they sound like they were coming toward you or going away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. They were going away at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Going the other way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How could you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. They were getting further in the distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see this man do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He turned and walked out of the lobby and went up West Jefferson
toward the theatre, and I walked out the front and watched him, and
he went into the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What theatre is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you happen to watch this particular man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He just looked funny to me. Well, in the first place, I had
seen him some place before. I think he had been in my store before. And
when you wait on somebody, you recognize them, and he just seemed funny.
His hair was sort of messed up and looked like he had been running, and he
looked scared, and he looked funny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice any of his actions when he was standing in your
lobby there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No; he just stood there and stared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He stared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he looking at the merchandise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Not anything in particular. He was just standing there staring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, would you state then what happened? You said that you
saw him walk into the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He walked into the Texas Theatre and I walked up to the
theatre, to the box office and asked Mrs. Postal if she sold a ticket to a man
who was wearing a brown shirt, and she said no, she hadn't. She was listening
to the radio herself. And I said that a man walked in there, and I was going
to go inside and ask the usher if he had seen him.</p>

<p>So I walked in and Butch <span class="locked">Burroughs&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was Burroughs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He was behind the counter. He operated the concession and
takes tickets. He was behind the concession stand and I asked him if he had
seen a man in a brown shirt of that description, matching that description,
and he said he had been working behind the counter and hadn't seen anybody.</p>

<p>And I asked him if he would come with me and show me where the exits
were and we would check the exits. And he asked me why.</p>

<p>I told him that I thought the guy looked suspicious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you tell whether or not he bought a ticket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No; he just turned and walked right straight in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he walked right straight in, could you see the box office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, the box office is right in the middle in front of the
theatre, and he turned right at the corner and went in. You could see him
if he was buying a ticket, because the box office is flush with all the other
buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If he had purchased a ticket, would you have seen him purchasing
the ticket from where you were standing or walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I could have seen him, yes; standing in front of the box office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then did you know when you saw him walk in and when you
walked up to Julia Postal that he had not bought a ticket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I knew that he hadn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you ask Julia Postal whether he had or hadn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You just asked her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Just asked her whether he had bought or she had seen him go in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. She&mdash;did she say whether she had seen him, or don't you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. She said she couldn't remember a man of that description going in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You saw this person Butch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say he is the usher, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you and Butch do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. We walked down to the front of the theatre to the stage. First
we checked the front exit, and it hadn't been opened. We went to the back and
it hadn't been opened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How could you tell that it hadn't been opened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, you open it from the inside, and you raise a bar, and
a rod sticks into a hole at the bottom and then you open it. When you close it,
it doesn't fall back in. You have to raise the rod again to close it from the
inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, you have to close it from the inside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. You can close it from the outside, but it won't lock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was locked when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you knew that no one had left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. We went back up front and went in the balcony and looked
around but we couldn't see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you first looked on the bottom floor and you did not see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many patrons were in the theatre at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I couldn't really tell. There weren't many, but it was dark and
we couldn't see how many people were in there. There were 15 or 20. I would
say, at the most, upstairs and downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Together, 15 or 20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went upstairs. Did you see him upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No; I couldn't see anything upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any noises there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. When we first went down to the exit by the stage, we heard a
seat pop up, but couldn't see anybody. And we never did see him.</p>

<p>But we went back and upstairs and checked, and we came down and went
back to the box office and told Julia that we hadn't seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Julia Postal is the cashier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes; and she called the police, and we went&mdash;Butch went to
the front exit, and I went down by the stage to the back exit and stood there
until the police came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, just before they came, they turned the house lights on,
and I looked out from the curtains and saw the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He was in the center section about six or seven rows, from the
back, toward the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Toward the back? Are you sure?
Mr. Brewer, do you know exactly which row he was in from the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No; I don't know which row.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He stood up and walked to the aisle to his right and then he
turned around and walked back and sat down and at this time there was no
place I could see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he sit down in the same seat he had been in to begin with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't remember if it was the same seat or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I heard a noise outside, and I opened the door, and the alley,
I guess it was filled with police cars and policemen were on the fire exits and
stacked around the alley, and they grabbed me, a couple of them and held
and searched me and asked me what I was doing there, and I told them that
there was a guy in the theatre that I was suspicious of, and he asked me if he
was still there.</p>

<p>And I said, yes, I just seen him. And he asked me if I would point him out.</p>

<p>And I and two or three other officers walked out on the stage and I pointed
him out, and there were officers coming in from the front of the show, I guess,
coming toward that way, and officers going from the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, I saw this policeman approach Oswald, and Oswald stood
up and I heard some hollering, I don't know exactly what he said, and this
man hit Patrolman McDonald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say this man hit Patrolman McDonald. Did you know it
was Patrolman McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I didn't know his name, but I had seen him quite a few times
around Oak Cliff. But I didn't know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you later found out this was Patrolman McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you say this man was the same man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. The same man that had stood in my lobby that I followed to
the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who hit who first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Oswald hit McDonald first, and he knocked him to the seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who knocked who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He knocked McDonald down. McDonald fell against one of
the seats. And then real quick he was back up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. McDonald was back up. He just knocked him down for a second
and he was back up. And I jumped off the stage and was walking toward
that, and I saw this gun come up and&mdash;in Oswald's hand, a gun up in the air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see from where the gun came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw the gun up in the air?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. And somebody hollered "He's got a gun."</p>

<p>And there were a couple of officers fighting him and taking the gun away from
him, and they took the gun from him, and he was fighting, still fighting, and I
heard some of the police holler, I don't know who it was, "Kill the President,
will you." And I saw fists flying and they were hitting him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he fighting back at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes; he was fighting back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, just in a short time they put the handcuffs on him and
they took him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see police officers hit him after they got the handcuffs on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No; I didn't see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any police officer hit Oswald after Oswald stopped fighting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear Oswald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. As they were taking him out, he stopped and turned around
and hollered. "I am not resisting arrest," about twice. "I am not resisting
arrest." And they took him on outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, then, the police officers and plainclothesmen, whoever
they were, got everybody that was in the theatre and set them aside, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
another officer was taking their names and addresses of all the people that
were in the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you first saw this man, when you saw him leave what you
referred to as the lobby of your shoestore building, what is it, marble or concrete?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Terrazzo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Terrazzo between the sidewalk and your front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was behind the counter there by the hose bar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far were you from the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Ten feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see through there to get a good view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes; the doors are solid glass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you saw this man leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I went out the front door and stood in front of the store
and watched him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You stood in front of the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he walking when you first saw him? As you got
out in front of your store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He was, I would say, he was in front of the furniture store.
What is the name of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that be Thompson's Furniture Store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you know&mdash;notice how fast this man was walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Just a little faster than usual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Faster than usual walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then about how far were you behind him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, I stood there until he walked into the theatre. I don't
really know what I was thinking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You stood in front of your store as he walked into the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far is the entrance of the theatre from your store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I would say 50 or 60 feet&mdash;yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then after you saw him turn into the theatre, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Then I walked toward the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At an average pace, or above average?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't remember? About how long after you got to the
theatre did the police come in, if you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't remember that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember about what time it was when the police came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you can think of that in any way bears on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brewer, I am handing you what has been marked "Commission
Exhibit 150," and ask you to state whether or not that looks like
the shirt you saw the man wear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. That looks like the shirt, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice whether the man that wore it had any holes in
the elbows at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I didn't notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But this Exhibit 150, looks like the shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. It looks like the shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he wearing a jacket? I believe you answered that before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, he didn't have on a jacket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear this man as he was in the theatre say anything
other than "I am not resisting arrest."?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything, or could you not understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He said something, but I couldn't understand what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he said, "I am not resisting arrest," was this before or
after they had the handcuffs on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. After.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brewer, you have the right, if you want, to come back and
read this deposition and sign it, or you can just waive the signing of it and
let the court reporter send it directly to us in Washington. Do you have any
preference on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to waive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We want to thank you for all of your cooperation on this. I
might ask one other question. We chatted for a few minutes when we first met
before we started taking this deposition, did we not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything we talked there about that isn't recorded in
this written testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything you said which is different insofar as stating
the facts and what you have stated here on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When we first met, what is the fact as to whether or not I
just asked you to tell your story, or whether or not I tried to tell you what I
thought the story was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. You asked me to tell the story first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Please thank Hardy's Shoe Store for us for letting you take
the time to be here. We thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Okay.</p>

<h2 id="t8">TESTIMONY OF JULIA POSTAL</h2>

<p>The testimony of Julia Postal was taken at 3 p.m., on April 2, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you stand and hold up your hand, please and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before this Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Julia Postal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your address, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. 2728 Seevers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you tell me something about yourself, where you were born
and what your education was, what your occupation has been, just in general.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Was born here in Dallas and I went through all school here to
my first year at Adamson, and went to California and finished up out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Finished high school there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Went through 4 years of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In California?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. In California, and then I lived there for 12 years and came back
here. I have been here ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What has been your occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Well, basically it has been theatre, cashier, and officework in
connection with theatres.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have been to California? Did you work in theatres there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir; I worked at the Paramount Theatre, and Graumans,
and R.K.O. Used to work for the Pantages. Worked for the Wilshire in the
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been back from California, to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Oh, me, I have been there 11 years, 14 or 15 years; really, I don't
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you been working? You are now working where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. With the Texas&mdash;really, it is United Theatres, Inc., at the Texas
Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been working there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. It was 11 years last November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Same theatre?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Same theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were your hours of work last fall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Last fall? Well, let's see, I worked in the office, and then
started cutting down personnel and I worked in the office until they opened the
box office at 12:45, and then come down to the box office and worked until 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you say worked in the box office, is that take tickets?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Sell tickets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Sell tickets. Is there a ticket taker inside the theatre?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir; now, during the slack period like this with school,
just an usher who works the concession and tears the tickets, because it is just
straight through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, Friday, November 22, 1963, what time did your
box office open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. We open daily at 12:45, sometimes may be 5, 4 minutes later
or something, but that is our regular hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On this day you opened on 12:45, November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And on that day, did you have the ticket taker working around
12:45, 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Just the usher, which, as I said, works the concession and ticket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Warren Burroughs. Call him Butch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Butch Burroughs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he stationed inside the door, the entrance to the theatre?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir; he stays, actually, behind the concession counter, but
as I said, the concession runs for the entire way as you go in the door and it
runs this way so that you can see the door and steps insides, and tears tickets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you have a radio in your ticket office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Uh-huh, a transistor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you heard that the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; my daughter had called me at the office before we opened
up and said it was on the TV, so I then turned the little transistor on right
away, and of course it verified the&mdash;they were saying again that he had been
shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you find out that he had died here? That President Kennedy
was dead <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't hear that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. I was listening to KLIF, and I was down in the little box office,
and they kept saying that Parkland hadn't issued an official report, that he had
been removed from the operating table, and everyone wanted to surmise, but
still hope, and it was after this that they came out and said that he was
officially dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But, you didn't hear that when you were in the box office, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, I did. In fact, I was just about&mdash;it was just about the
time all chaos broke loose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did many people go into the theatre from the time you opened
at the box office until about 1:15 or so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many? Can you give me an estimate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. I believe 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Twenty-four?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Fourteen or twenty-four. I believe it was 24. Everything
was happening so fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had sold about that many tickets?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the price of admission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. We had three. Adults 90 cents, teenager with a card is 50 cents,
and a child is 35, and you have a pass ticket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is cheaper that time of day than other times of day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; we don't change prices. Used to, but we don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Same price?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you see anybody go in the theatre&mdash;well, did you see any
activity on the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Now, yes, sir; just about the time we opened, my employer had
stayed and took the tickets because we change pictures on Thursday and want to
do anything, he&mdash;and about this time I heard the sirens&mdash;police was racing
back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. On Jefferson Boulevard, and then we made the remark, "Something
is about to bust," or "pop," or something to that effect, so, it was just
about&mdash;some sirens were going west, and my employer got in his car. He was
parked in front, to go up to see where they were going. He, perhaps I said, he
passed Oswald. At that time I didn't know it was Oswald. Had to bypass him,
because as he went through this way, Oswald went through this way and ducked
into the theatre there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me see. Had you ever seen this man before then at that
particular theatre?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Not that I know of, huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A police car had gone by just before this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir; going west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Its siren on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; full blast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And after you saw the police car go west with its siren on, why at
the time the police car went west with its siren on, did you see the man that
ducked? This man that you <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. This man, yes; he ducked into the box office and&mdash;I don't know
if you are familiar with the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; I have seen the theatre.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. You have? Well, he was coming from east going west. In other
words, he ducked right in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ducked in, what do you mean? He had come around the <span class="locked">corner&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; and when the sirens went by he had a panicked look on
his face, and he ducked in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, as the car went by, you say the man ducked in, had you seen
him before the car went by, the police went by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; I was looking up, as I say, when the cars passed, as you
know, they make a tremendous noise, and he ducked in as my boss went that
way to get in his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is your boss?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Mr. John A. Callahan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you say he was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; I say, they bypassed each other, actually, the man ducked in
this way and my employer went that-a-way, to get in his car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you say "ducked in," you mean he entered the door from the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; just ducked into the other&mdash;into the outer part of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see, out in the open space?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir; just right around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just right around the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And your boss passed him, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; they went&mdash;one came one way, and one went the other way
just at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see him do after he came around the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Well, I didn't actually&mdash;because I stepped out of the box office
and went to the front and was facing west. I was right at the box office facing
west, because I thought the police were stopping up quite a ways. Well, just as
I turned around then Johnny Brewer was standing there and he asked me if the
fellow that ducked in bought a ticket, and I said, "No; by golly, he didn't," and
turned around expecting to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he had ducked in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. And Mr. Brewer said he had been ducking in at his place of
business, and he had gone by me, because I was facing west, and I said, "Go in
and see if you can see him," it isn't too much people in there. So, he came and
says, well, he didn't see him, and I says, "Well, he has to be there." So I told
him to go back and check&mdash;we have exit doors, behind&mdash;one behind the stage and
one straight through, and asked him to check them, check the lounges because
I knew he was in there. Well, he just had to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The last time you had seen him before he ducked in, he was just
standing outside of the door, was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; he was still just in&mdash;just off of the sidewalk, and he
headed for the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the doors of the theatre open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was closed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. It was closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you didn't see him actually enter the theatre then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You hadn't seen him go by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. I knew he didn't go by me, because I was facing west, and
Johnny, he had come up from east which meant he didn't go back that way. He
had come from east going west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, now what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Well, I, like&mdash;I told him&mdash;asked him to check everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask Butch Burroughs if he had seen him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; I told Johnny this, don't tell him, because he is an
excitable person, and just have him, you know, go with you and examine the
exits and check real good, so, he came back and said he hadn't seen anything
although, he had heard a seat pop up like somebody getting out, but there was
nobody around that area, so, I told Johnny about the fact that the President
had been assassinated. "I don't know if this is the man they want," I said,
"in there, but he is running from them for some reason," and I said "I am
going to call the police, and you and Butch go get on each of the exit doors
and stay there."</p>

<p>So, well, I called the police, and he wanted to know why I thought it was
their man, and I said, "Well, I didn't know," and he said, "Well, it fits the
description," and I have not&mdash;I said I hadn't heard the description. All I
know is, "This man is running from them for some reason." And he wanted
to know why, and told him because everytime the sirens go by he would duck
and he wanted to know&mdash;well, if he fits the description is what he says. I said,
"Let me tell you what he looks like and you take it from there." And explained
that he had on this brown sports shirt and I couldn't tell you what design it was,
and medium height, ruddy looking to me, and he said, "Thank you," and I called
the operator and asked him to look through the little hole and see if he could
see anything and told him I had called the police, and what was happening, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
he wanted to know if I wanted him to cut the picture off, and I says, "No, let's
wait until they get here." So, seemed like I hung up the intercom phone when
here all of a sudden, police cars, policemen, plainclothesmen, I never saw so
many people in my life. And they raced in, and the next thing I knew, they
were carrying&mdash;well, that is when I first heard Officer Tippit had been shot
because some officer came in the box office and used the phone, said, "I think
we have got our man on both accounts." "What two accounts?" And said,
"Well, Officer Tippit's," shocked me, because Officer Tippit used to work part
time for us years ago. I didn't know him personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean he guarded the theatre?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. On Friday nights and Saturdays, canvass the theatre, you know,
and that&mdash;then they were bringing Oswald out the door over there <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, now, was this before they had gone into the theatre that this
officer used the phone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. There was not one man walked through this theatre. They
were running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the officers go in the front of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes. Definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; I stayed at the box office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't see anything that happened inside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see them bring a man out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many men had hold of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Well, I&mdash;like I said, the public was getting there at that time,
and the streets, sidewalk and around the streets and everything and they
brought him out the double doors here [indicating]. I remember, the officer had
his hands behind him with his chin back like this [indicating] because I understand
he had been using some profuse (sic) language which&mdash;inside. I'd say
four or five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. I don't know, sir, because the officers were all around him and
from the rear there and his hands were to his back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And an officer had hold of him from the side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir; this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With his arm underneath his chin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have any bruises or cuts? Did Oswald have any bruises or
cuts on his face?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't see any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No; huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he saying anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; as I said, that was my understanding, that is the reason
that they had him like that, because he was screaming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But, you didn't hear him say anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir. He couldn't possibly say anything the way they had
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. That is when I really started shaking. I had never seen a live
mob scene, <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. They said, "What is going on?" And someone said, "Suspect,"
and they started in this way, just about that time I got out to the box office,
back to the box office, and they started screaming profuse language and&mdash;"Kill
the so-and-so," and trying to get to him, and this and that and the officers were
trying to hold on to Oswald&mdash;when I say, "Oswald," that man, because as I said, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
didn't know who he was at that time and they was trying to hold him, because
he was putting up a struggle, and then trying to keep the public off, and on the
way to the car, parked right out front, one of the officers was&mdash;at that time I
thought he was putting his hat on the man's face to try to keep the public from
grabbing him by the hair, but I later read in the paper it was to cover his face
and then he got him in the car, and all bedlam, so far as the public, broke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They drove away with him, did they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir; that one car did; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever go down to the police station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; later the city hall or police office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; I went down to the homicidal bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Well, let's see, that was a Friday. I believe it was the Thursday
following.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't go down there that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down there the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. According to your affidavit, it shows that you signed it on the
4th of December. Would that be about right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Was that on Thursday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; I think.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. I can't remember. I think it was a Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was after Oswald was dead?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; well, yes; because he was killed on the 24th, yes; because
I know I didn't go down until the following week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, was it after Oswald, the man brought out on&mdash;out of the
theatre was taken away in the car that the officer called and said, "I'm sure
we have got our man&mdash;&mdash;"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; that officer came out of the theatre and grabbed at the
phone and made the call about simultaneously as they were bringing Oswald
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that was when you heard that Officer Tippit had been shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why didn't Warren Burroughs see him get in, get in there? Do
you have any idea?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. We talked about that, and the concession stand is along here,
and if he came in on the other end, which we summarized that is what Oswald
did, because the steps, immediately as you open the door there. It has been
done before with kids trying to sneak in, run right on up in the balcony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You asked Warren Burroughs why he didn't see him, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; we kidded him quite a bit anyway, because some people do
then get by him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Ah, he said at first that he had seen him, and I says, "Now,
Butch, if you saw him come in&mdash;" says, "Well, I saw him going out." But he
didn't really see him. So, he just summarized that he ran up in the balcony,
because if he had come through the foyer, Butch would have seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was arrested, though, down in the orchestra, the second row
from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Third?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Three rows down, five seats over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I was trying to say the third row. How could he get from the
balcony down there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Oh, that is very easy. You can go up in the balcony and right
straight down, those steps come back down, and that would bring you into it.
He wouldn't have to go by Butch at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oh, I see. And he could get into the balcony without Butch's seeing
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes; if Butch was down in the other end getting something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he could go in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. He could have gotten in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. I show you an Exhibit 150, a shirt. Does that look
anything like the shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Yes, it was something like this shirt. I couldn't say it is the
same except it was brown and it was hanging out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Outside his pants?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wasn't tucked into his pants?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he went in was it tucked in his pants when he went in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. No, sir; because I remember he came flying around the corner,
because his hair was and shirt was kind of waving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And his shirt was out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. It was hanging out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Postal, this will be written up and you can read it and sign it
if you wish, or you can waive signature and we will send it on to the Commission
without your signature. Now, how do you feel about it? Do you want to do
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. I don't know. I mean, this is all new to me anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you just as leave waive your signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Postal</span>. Well, I see no reason why not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay. Fine.</p>

<p>Then you don't have to come down and sign it. We will send it without
your signature. Thank you, very much for coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Well, I'm going to private school 2 days a week. I stopped
going to public school in the ninth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You quit in the ninth grade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I stopped in the ninth grade, but I'm going to private school
2 days a week over in Highland Park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes; I am now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Twenty-two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What have you been doing most of your life&mdash;what kind of work
have you been doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I worked at the Texas Theatre and I helped my dad out as
an apprentice, he is an electrician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you ever in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No, sir&mdash;they tried to get me, but I couldn't pass&mdash;I passed
the physical part, but the mental part&mdash;I didn't make enough points on the
score, so the board sent me a card back and classifying me different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, you were working at the Texas Theatre,
were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of job did you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. During the week I worked behind the concession. On weekends
I usher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On weekends you usher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. During the week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I am behind the concession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. During the afternoon of the week&mdash;do you take tickets too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes&mdash;I take tickets every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And, run the concession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If anybody comes in there without a ticket, what do you do,
run them off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I make it a point to stop them and ask them to go out and
get a ticket. I just failed to see him when he slipped in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will get to that in a minute&mdash;I want to see what you usually
do if somebody comes in without a ticket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I stop them and have them go out to the box office and get an
admission ticket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On this day of November 22, 1963, what time did you go to
work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I went to work at 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to work that day at 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. That day at 12 o'clock&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you later saw a struggle in the theatre between a man and
some officers, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see that man come in the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any idea what you were doing when he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Well, I was&mdash;I had a lot of stock candy to count and put
in the candy case for the coming night, and if he had came around in front
of the concession out there, I would have seen him, even though I was bent down,
I would have seen him, but otherwise&mdash;I think he sneaked up the stairs real
fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Up to the balcony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;first, I think he was up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At least there was a stairway there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes, there was two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there a stairway near the entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Of the door&mdash;yes. Yes, it goes straight&mdash;you come through
the door and go straight&mdash;you go upstairs to the balcony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody come in there that day? Up to the time of the struggle
between the man and the police&mdash;who didn't have a ticket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Later on the police came in your place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They asked you if you had seen a man come in there without a
ticket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I said, "I haven't seen him myself. He might have, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
didn't see him when he came in. He must have sneaked in and run on upstairs
before I saw him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Later on, did somebody point out a man in the theatre to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No&mdash;I got information that a man&mdash;the police were cruising
up and down Jefferson hunting for Oswald, and he ran to a shoestore and
then came out and came on up to the Texas, and the man came in and told me
that a man fitting that description came in the show and he wanted me to
help him find him, and we went and checked the exit doors, he was up in the
balcony, I imagine, and then we went back out and the police caught him downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to check the exit doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With the shoe salesman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were the police out at the exit doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. They came on&mdash;somehow they came in&mdash;one came in through
the back and the rest of them came in through the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see them come in through the back when you were back
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I saw one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The exit doors you are talking about were in the back or in the
front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. They are at the back&mdash;they have one main one going out
to the alley and they have one down here by the stage going out to the parking
lot, and the other two are upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any struggle or fight between this man and any police
officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No; not exactly, because I just had one door open and that
was the middle door, and I couldn't see them&mdash;that was the main thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I was back behind the concession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How do you get from the exit door in the rear of the theatre to
behind the concession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Well, the concession is right here [indicating] and the doors
are right here, and the theatre is inside, and exit door No. 1 is straight down
this way and another one is straight down this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what you did after you went to the exit door with the
shoe salesman; what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Well, he went down to this door and I stayed at this door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean at the rear of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes&mdash;he went down to the rear of the theatre, and I stayed
at this door in case he went out one of the exit doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You stayed there, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I stayed there for about 5 minutes and I came back out to
the concession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Down the main aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there police in there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. They were in there checking to see where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any struggle going on when you came back from the
exit door to the concession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear or see any trouble between this man and the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Well, I heard a struggle from outside, but I really couldn't
tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Well, I couldn't hear anything on the inside, but when they
brought him out, he was hollering and raising, "I demand my rights," and all
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else did you hear?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. That's about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what his appearance was as they brought him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Well, he didn't seem&mdash;he seemed like he was mad at everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he shout in a loud voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes; like&mdash;"I demand my rights" [witness holding up both
hands above his head.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Well, they carried him out to the car and there was a mob
of people out there&mdash;more people than I have ever seen before and they put
him in the car and went off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many officers were with him? When you saw them take him
from the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I believe about three or four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did any of them have ahold of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes; they had ahold of him&mdash;they were dragging him out&mdash;I
mean they had ahold of him&mdash;two on each side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he walking or were they dragging him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. He was walking, but he was kind of urged on out the door
into the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were his hands behind him or in front of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. They were behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see a police officer strike him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a police officer with his arm around the neck of this
man, who arrested him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see a police officer strike this man with the butt
of a shotgun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were any of the officers in the theatre armed with shotguns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. No, sir; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all, Mr. Burroughs, and this will be written up and
you can go down and sign it if you wish, or you can waive your signature right
now. Which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I want to come down and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. You will be notified to come down and you can read
it over and sign it. Thank you very much for coming down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. Thank you. I hope I helped you some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; I hope you did, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burroughs</span>. I'll see you later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Goodby.</p>

<h2 id="t17">TESTIMONY OF BOB K. CARROLL</h2>

<p>The testimony of Bob K. Carroll was taken at 9 a.m., on April 3, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Carroll, would you stand up please and take the oath.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before this
Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Bob K. Carroll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your residence address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. 814 Redbud, Duncanville, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Detective, Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Ten years and three months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me something about yourself? Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I was born here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Sunset High.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you go beyond high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after you got out of high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Actually, I quit high school in 1947 and went to work at
Vitalic Battery Co. [spelling] V-i-t-a-l-i-c. I worked there off and on, sometimes
I believe during the seasonal layoffs and I would go back when they
started rehiring, and I worked there until I went on active duty with the
Marine Corps March 1, 1952, and I was released from active duty in May
of 1953, and when I returned to Dallas I went to work for James A. Lewis
Engineering Co., and I worked for them for approximately 18 months and then
I worked 2 months for the Texas Highway Department on a survey crew, and
then I joined the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Since I have been in the Dallas Police Department, I have worked the radio
and patrol divisions, the accident prevention bureau and the special service
bureau. While assigned to the special service bureau, I worked with the
narcotics section, the criminal intelligence section and the vice section and the
administrative section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were your hours of work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. We were instructed to be in the assembly room at 10 a.m. for
briefing prior to the arrival of President Kennedy, and at that time I was
in the assembly room at 8 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What job was assigned to you that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I was assigned to the 700 block of Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Along the curb&mdash;did you stand along the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; to be there, and, of course, there were uniform
officers also assigned in that block, but I think they had one detective for each
block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far is 700 Main Street from Houston and Main?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. That would be roughly about three blocks&mdash;three or four blocks,
maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear the sound of any shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you first hear that the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I had walked around to a tavern around the corner. I was
walking down the street and I passed this person I know and I stepped in this
tavern to speak to him and I heard it&mdash;they turned on the TV just as I walked
in the door and I heard it on the TV set.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I left and went to the office, and when I got to the office I called
the dispatcher and they told me to go to the scene and I left the office and went
to the garage, which is two blocks from city hall and got a car and reported to
the School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time did you get to the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Let's see&mdash;approximately&mdash;let's see, the shooting occurred&mdash;it
was 12:30, I believe, it was approximately 1 o'clock&mdash;maybe a little before, but
right around 1 o'clock, and after I got to the Depository, they started organizing
search details and I was assigned to search the basement. Well, I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
into the basement and we determined that we needed some light in the basement,
so I came back upstairs to get some lights, and when I got upstairs I
heard that an officer had been shot in Oak Cliff, and no one had any information
on it and the people I talked to had no information, so I got on the phone, and
I called the dispatcher's office. The dispatcher stated it was Officer Tippit who
was shot and he was dead, and so when I come back out of the office where I
had used the phone, I requested permission to go to Oak Cliff and permission
was granted and I took K.&nbsp;E. Lyons, and he and I left for Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is K.&nbsp;E. Lyons a detective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. He is a patrolman assigned to the special service bureau. He
doesn't work in uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He works in plain clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. He works in plain clothes, but his rank is patrolman, but we
were in the 300 block of East Jefferson when the call came out on the radio
that a suspect had been seen going into the Texas Theatre. We went immediately
to the Texas Theatre, which is about five blocks away&mdash;I think it is in the
200 block of West Jefferson, and ourselves and the radio patrol unit were the
first units to arrive at the theatre, and we pulled to the curb and parked
directly in front of the entrance to the theatre, and the radio patrol car pulled
into the head-in parking behind us. When Lyons and I went in, a lady that
was in the theatre&mdash;I don't know who she was&mdash;she said he was upstairs, and
that was all the conversation I heard from her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who the lady was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it the girl who sells tickets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't know, sir, whether it was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you ever met Julia Postal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; I never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where was the lady when you talked to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I didn't actually talk to her, sir, but when we went through
the door, she just more or less&mdash;she just made a statement that he was upstairs,
and as far as having any direct conversation with her, we did not. She said
upstairs and we immediately went up to the balcony. All of the house lights
were turned on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and Lyons went in the front door then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; and we went into the balcony and we had&mdash;or rather
I had satisfied myself with the fact that he wasn't in the balcony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anyone in the balcony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Well, there were people sitting around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you satisfy yourself that he was in the balcony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Well, we went in and had more or less a vague idea&mdash;well, the
people that I saw up in the balcony were either real young or older people and so
we started back <span class="locked">down&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you had a description of the man you were looking for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. They gave me a vague one on the telephone when I called and
checked about the officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who are "they"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Whoever was on duty at the dispatcher's office&mdash;I don't know
who it was at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the description that he gave you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. He just gave a general height description and age&mdash;just generally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I'm trying to recall now exactly&mdash;he gave the height and I can't
recall now exactly how he said it&mdash;it's been so long ago, and it was all&mdash;I know
he gave roughly, just a rough description. It wasn't a detailed description at
all, and I'm trying to remember now exactly how he worded it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you give me the approximate age&mdash;around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I believe he said he was between 20 or 25 or something, like
that, I'm not quite sure, because everything moved real fast and everything like
that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you don't have anything from which you can refresh your
memory, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; not as to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't make a note of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. It was just strictly a telephone conversation&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At any rate, when you looked at the balcony, did you see anyone
who fitted this vague description that had been given you over the telephone
by the dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Not that I thought fit it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Well, I started down the stairs and was going back down to the
lower floor when I heard someone holler something&mdash;I believe it was "Here he
is," or something like that. I mean, it was a loud holler, you could tell it wasn't
just someone talking, and I started running, and Lyons fell&mdash;he sprained his
ankle&mdash;and I started running and I came up to the right of Oswald. I came up to
the right and Sergeant Hill to the left, and then Ray Hawkins was in the aisle
behind him&mdash;he come up in the aisle behind from the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You came from the left aisle, did you, down the row of seats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; facing the screen, I came from the right aisle and then
come up on Oswald's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who came from Oswald's left, facing the screen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Jerry Hill&mdash;Sgt. Jerry Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then, who came from behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Ray Hawkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you heard the sound "I've got him"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Just coming off of the stairs from the balcony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you ran to the orchestra entrance&mdash;did you&mdash;to the aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. To the aisle from the lobby&mdash;you come downstairs into the lower
lobby and the aisles lead off the lower lobby, and I come through the lobby and
he was sitting rather close, I don't know exactly which row of seats it was, but
it was back close to the back of the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how many seats in from the right aisle, as you faced the
screen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. It was approximately&mdash;close to the center of the second bunch
of seats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see when you came into the entrance to the aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I saw standing up at the time&mdash;Oswald was standing up there
at that time. Several of us were converging at the same time upon him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. He was on Oswald's, let me see, the first time I think I saw
Nick was, I believe he was on Oswald's right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they struggling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Everyone was struggling with him&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I mean, were Oswald and McDonald struggling together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; and then when I got up close enough, I saw a pistol
pointing at me so I reached and grabbed the pistol and jerked the pistol away
and stuck it in my belt, and then I grabbed Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who had hold of that pistol at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't know, sir. I just saw the pistol pointing at me and I
grabbed it and jerked it away from whoever had it and that's all, and by that
time then the handcuffs were put on Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who put them on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I'm not sure who actually put the handcuffs on&mdash;I think it was
Ray Hawkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put them on from behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Did&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. They were behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody strike Oswald with his fist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We had one witness testify yesterday that he saw a man with a
shotgun strike Oswald in the back with the butt of the gun; did you see that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; I didn't see that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody strike him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I didn't see anybody strike him&mdash;it's possible that someone did,
but I didn't see it because I was busy just trying to get him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you grab some part of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; I grabbed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. It was below his shoulders, I think I grabbed him by his arm,
trying to get one arm behind him or something.</p>

<p>I mean, it all happened so fast&mdash;as far as me sitting down and detailing it&mdash;I
believe it was his right arm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Oswald saying anything during this struggle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Not that you could understand, you know; he was making sounds
like normally they will do when you are engaged in some kind of a vigorous
scuffle or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened then after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Well, after we got the handcuffs on him&mdash;it was McDonald and
Jerry Hill, Ray Hawkins and myself, and I believe there was&mdash;I think it was
Hutson&mdash;we started out of the theatre and we took him out through the main
lobby to our car, which was parked right in front where we had left it&mdash;where
Lyons and I pulled up, and we put him in our car in the back seat and I was
driving and Jerry Hill was riding next to me and somewhere after this deal,
someway or other&mdash;I don't know exactly when it was&mdash;Paul Bentley had joined
the crowd, and he got into the car in the right-front seat and then Oswald and
Hutson, I believe, were in the back seat, and we left there and drove to the
police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After Oswald had been handcuffed, did he say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; as we were bringing him out of the theatre, he hollered
that he was going to protest this police brutality. I believe those were his
words&mdash;the latter part&mdash;"Protest the police brutality" were his exact words.
The rest of it was what he had done and that he hadn't done nothing and stuff
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say he hadn't done anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. The best I remember that was it&mdash;after we had him in the car.
We were coming down to the station and he said that he hadn't done anything
and he said, "I did have a pistol and I know that that's wrong, but I haven't
done anything." That's the best I recall of what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any marks on Oswald's face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes&mdash;there was one, I believe it was on the left&mdash;right eye&mdash;I
can't recall which one it was&mdash;I know he had a mark up here, somewhere up
here, I believe it was over his left eye&mdash;I'm not real sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was Oswald the first time you saw the mark over his eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. The first time I remember was after we got him in the car. Of
course, I wasn't paying too much attention to the marks or anything right there,
we was trying to get him subdued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As he came out of the theatre, was he shouting in a loud voice or
speaking softly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Well, when we came out the door, it was rather difficult because
there was quite a crowd there outside the theatre and it was pretty noisy and
several people were hollering, you know&mdash;"Kill him," or "Let us have him, and
we'll kill him." It was rather noisy, and after we come out of the theatre&mdash;I
couldn't hear, you know, if he said anything I couldn't actually hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you shut Oswald up any way&mdash;did you do anything to keep
his mouth shut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A witness testified yesterday&mdash;he said that as Oswald came out of
the theatre, that there were two men on each side of him and one man behind
him that had his arm underneath his chin so as to tilt his head back and close
his mouth; do you remember anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't remember anything like that. I was in front&mdash;when
we came out of the theatre, I was directly in front of Oswald, and I say
"directly"&mdash;just almost right in front of him and there were two people, I know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
one each side of him had him by his arms, but I did not see anyone holding his
mouth or trying to keep his mouth shut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the way down to the police station, did anyone in the car ask
Oswald if he had shot the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't think&mdash;I don't think they asked him if he shot the
President. I don't recall asking him if he shot the President. I think most of
the conversation was about Tippit at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you remember as to that conversation about Tippit at the
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Like&mdash;he said he hadn't done anything except, well, he said,
"I had a pistol, and that's all I've done&mdash;just carry a pistol."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did any one officer state to Oswald that he had killed Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't recall him just coming out openly and saying, "You
killed him," or anything like that. Of course, questions were being asked. I
don't remember now who was asking them then, but I was driving the car and
I was trying to get him from out there down here as fast as we could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you took the pistol, what did you do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. The pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. After I took the pistol, I stuck it in my belt immediately. Then,
after we got into the car and pulled out from the theater over there, I gave it to
Jerry Hill, Sgt. Jerry Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he was sitting in the front seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. In the front seat right beside me and in the middle, I think
Paul Bentley was sitting on the right side and Jerry was sitting there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went down to the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. When we got down in the basement and brought Oswald up,
I was in front with everyone else surrounding him and we walked directly from
the car to the elevator, got on the elevator and went up to the third floor to
the homicide and robbery office and took him right into the homicide and robbery
office and took him into one of our interrogation rooms, where we released
him to the homicide and robbery office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whom did you release him to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't recall which one of the officers it was&mdash;there were
several standing around there, but they would just take him and hand him to
one particular officer. We just put him in the room and they more or less come
in and we would back off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I went into the police personnel office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who went in there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. There was Jerry Hill, Ray Hawkins, McDonald, Hutson, Bentley,
Lyons, and myself. Oh, by the way, Lyons was in the car with us also
when we came from the theatre to the police department. I don't remember
whether he was sitting in the front or back seat, though, but he did come down
with us.</p>

<p>Lyons had sprained his ankle and Paul Bentley also had sprained his ankle,
and shortly after we went into the police personnel office Lyons and Bentley
left and went to Parkland to have their legs checked and taken care of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you looked at the pistol to see if it was loaded before you
got to the personnel office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; when I gave it to Jerry Hill, he unloaded it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He unloaded it there in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you able to see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Wait just a minute&mdash;I know he checked the cylinder and I
don't recall whether he actually unloaded it at the time or whether he waited
to unload it downtown, but I believe he unloaded it there at the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anyway, you know it was unloaded in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes; and I saw the bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was unloaded in your presence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how many bullets were there in the cylinder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Just&mdash;the cylinder was full&mdash;six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Six bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir. Yes; I believe it was full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was McDonald there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't recall whether he was right there at that moment or
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine these bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I looked at them, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything unusual about any one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Not&mdash;just at a glance. No, sir; they just looked like bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine them more carefully at a later time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Someone made mention that one of the caps, you know, had
a small indent on it, and I looked at it and I could see what looked to me like
a hammer might have fallen on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the firing pin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes&mdash;the firing pin looked like where the firing pin might
have fallen on the cap.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It looked like the firing pin had fallen on the cap?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you see that with your naked eye or did you need a glass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Well, when I looked at it, it looked to me like it was just a
real light indent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was without a glass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look at it as you were there in the personnel department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was McDonald there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I'm sure he was&mdash;I don't actually recall him sitting there. He
was there most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see McDonald make a mark on the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes; I saw him make a mark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was this done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. It was up in the personnel police office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At this meeting that you were just describing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes; when we were all in there together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And tell me briefly who was present when you saw McDonald
make the mark on the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Well, let's see&mdash;there was myself, Mack, I think Ray Hawkins
was there, and I believe Hutson was there, and I believe Bentley and Lyons had
already gone out to have their feet checked, and I don't recall whether Captain
Westbrook was in there at the time or not. There were so many people&mdash;I
would have to kind of explain that&mdash;I know it sounds vague, but there were
so many people in and out of there and there were about no less than anywhere
from half a dozen to a dozen newspaper reporters in and out and they were
bringing in mikes and it was just a big mess of confusion. You couldn't just
sit down and detail this thing and say this man was at this particular spot at
this time. It was so jumbled up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whom did you give the gun to finally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. After I gave it to&mdash;Jerry Hill&mdash;that was the last time I had
possession of it&mdash;possession of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you know who took possession of the bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't recall, sir. I don't recall even seeing the gun or the
bullets turned over to anyone by Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you know in the personnel department after you had delivered
Oswald to the homicide squadron, you saw the gun and six bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With this group of officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you examined them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll, this will be written up by the shorthand reporter and you have
the privilege of looking it over and making any corrections and signing it, if you
wish, or you can waive signature and we will send it on to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; all right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to waive signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; I will sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, then, if you want to sign it, we'll get in touch with you
and tell you what time it will be ready and you can come down and look it over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, fine. Thank you very much for coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t24">TESTIMONY OF BOB K. CARROLL RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of Bob K. Carroll was taken at 10 30 a.m., on April 9, 1984,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you rise and be sworn, please. Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your name is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Bob K. Carroll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You previously had your deposition taken here in Dallas by the
President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, have
you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Mr. Ball take that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. It was Mr. Ball; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what day was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. It was on a Friday, last, I believe. I don't know what day
that would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, today is the following Thursday. At that time we didn't
have some of the exhibits here, Officer Carroll, and since then they have
come in. I now want to hand you one of the exhibits which has been marked
as Commission Exhibit 143 and ask you to state what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir. It is a .38 caliber revolver with a blue steel 2" barrel
with wooden handle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever seen this before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you first see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I first saw it in the Texas Theatre on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you just tell us about this weapon, when you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. The first time I saw the weapon, it was pointed in my direction,
and I reached and grabbed it and stuck it into my belt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you happen to be doing at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. At the time, I was assisting in the arrest of Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whose hand was on the gun when you saw it
pointed in your direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You just jumped and grabbed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I jumped and grabbed the gun; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Stuck it in my belt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. After leaving the theatre and getting into the car, I released
the pistol to Sgt. Jerry Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sgt. G.&nbsp;L. Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who drove the car down to the station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I drove the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you give it to him before you started up the car, or after
you started up the car, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. After.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far had you driven when you gave it to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't recall exactly how far I had driven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you put any identification mark at all on this weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; I did. The initials B.&nbsp;C., right above the screw on
the inside of the butt of the pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is about an inch or so from the bottom of the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Approximately an inch from the bottom of the butt of the
pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you hold the pistol pointing, that metal strip is pointing up
also, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you put the initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Where was I, or where did I put the initials on the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I was in the personnel office of the city of Dallas police
department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With Sergeant Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, and others who were present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see Sergeant Hill take it out of his pocket or wherever
he had it, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What day did you put your initials on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. During the drive down from the Texas Theatre, to the police
station, do you remember any conversation with Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Some. He stated that he had not done anything that&mdash;he said,
"Well, I was carrying a pistol, but that is all."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he ever asked his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes, sir; he was asked his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he give his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. He gave, the best I recall, I wasn't able to look closely, but the
best I recall, he gave two names, I think. I don't recall what the other one
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he give two names? Or did someone in the car read from
the identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Someone in the car may have read from the identification.
I know two names, the best I recall, were mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were any addresses mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Not that I recall; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk at any time to Oswald in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; I had no conversation with him personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were driving the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes. If I looked at him, I would have to turn around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to him after you got downtown to the station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear him say anything after he got downtown to the
station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No; I didn't hear him say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever hear anyone say anything about his having an
address on North Beckley or on Beckley Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I heard later, but I couldn't say who it was that said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say later, you mean later than what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Later that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this after you relinquished custody of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Up to that time had you heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I don't recall hearing it prior to the time I was in the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of, whether we have discussed this
or not, that in any way might be relevant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. No, sir; because when we brought him out of the car, we took him
straight up to the homicide and robbery office and there left him in custody
of a homicide and robbery officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When this gun, Commission Exhibit 143, was taken by you and
then subsequently given to Hill, did you at any time notice whether it was or
was not loaded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I observed Sergeant Hill unload the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many bullets were in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. It was full. I believe there was six bullets, the best I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, sir; we thank you again for making the second trip down,
and we are sorry we didn't have the exhibit here when you first testified.</p>

<p>You have an opportunity, if you like, to read your deposition and sign it
before it goes to Washington, or you can waive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. I will sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you will be contacted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>. All right, fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you please state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Thomas A. Hutson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Police officer for the city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you, Mr. Hutson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Thirty-five years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you been a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Nine years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go to school here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. High school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Graduate of high school or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Forest Avenue High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go when you got out of high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Went to work for Texas &amp; Pacific Railway in the general office
at Elm and Griffin Street as a mail clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. That was in 1947, in July&mdash;that is in January of 1947, and
I worked there continuously until July of 1948, when I enlisted in the U.S. Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you serve in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Four years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I went to Fort Ord, Calif., for basic training, and from there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
I went to Germany and joined the 1st Infantry Division, and I joined them
in October of 1948.</p>

<p>I landed in Germany and I stayed with them in Germany until May of 1951,
when I returned to the United States and was stationed at Fort Sam Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do, basically, in Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I started out in the Infantry, and when I left Germany I was
in a more or less administrative part of my Infantry company, doing mail and
administrative work in the sergeant's office. Plus, of course, you are primarily
an Infantry soldier anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got back to the States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Right. In May of 1951, and I went to Fort Sam Houston, Tex.,
where I was promoted to Infantry sergeant, platoon sergeant, and there I gave
instructions in Infantry tactics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And eventually you were discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I went to Camp Pickett, Va., and we were there&mdash;this was during
the Korean war when I started to train men in Camp Pickett, Va., and I got
an extended year from a 3-year enlistment, and I was discharged in July of 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Honorable discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I returned to Dallas and went back to work for Texas &amp; Pacific
Railway as an interchange clerk in the accounting office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I stayed with Texas &amp; Pacific for approximately a year, and at
this time I resigned and a lifelong friend and I went into the service station
business at Harwood and Grand here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay in the service station business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. We stayed in the service station business 18 months. I sold
my interest to him around February the 5th, and I went to work for the Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were your duties in the Dallas Police Department in the
fall of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I was a 3-wheel motorcycle officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that have included November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir; it would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do in connection with the Presidential
motorcade on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I was in charge of "no parking" on all of North Harwood Street
and Main Street to Field on both sides of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After the motorcade passed down Main, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I was at Main and Ervay Avenue, and after the motorcade
passed, I began to pick up my "No-parking" signs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you at Main and Ervay when the motorcade passed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To direct traffic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I was trying&mdash;we were trying to hold the noon crowds back
that was surging in the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After the motorcade passed, then you started picking up the signs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. As I was picking up the signs, I heard a Signal 19, involving
the President of the United States at Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now had you heard anything ahead of that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I saw this squad car go by me with the siren on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. And as I got back to my motorcycle from picking up the signs,
I heard the Signal 19, involving the President of the United States at Elm and
Houston. I immediately made an emergency run to this location.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I pulled up in front of the Texas School Book Depository and
got off my motorcycle and took a position up on the sidewalk in front of the
main entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now there are a few steps between the sidewalk and the main
entrance. Were you at the bottom of the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes; I was at the bottom of the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do at the bottom of the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I stopped people and screened them from trying to enter, and
prevented anyone from leaving if he got through the other two officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were there with two more officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. They were at the top of the stairs at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know the names of these officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I am not positive, but the best of my knowledge, it was J.&nbsp;B.
Garrick and H.&nbsp;R. Freeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were those officers there when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they motorcycle officers or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Solo motorcycle officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I don't know the exact amount of time that I stayed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your best judgment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I was relieved by my sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you let people go in that said they were employees within
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir. One lady came up that was an employee. I refused
to let anyone enter except police officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone leave the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was your back to the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now there were lots of people milling around at that time, I
assume?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Not at the entrance, there wasn't when I first got there. There
wasn't a big crowd around that building, but all the sirens coming in, that is
what brought the big crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you hear any witnesses say they had seen a rifle or anything
from the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you left. What did you do when you were relieved from
duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. As I was being released, I heard the radio dispatcher come on
the radio and give a Signal 19, and that a shooting involving a police officer
in the 500 block of East Jefferson, and he came back on shortly and said to check
both 500 East Jefferson and East Tenth, that they weren't sure on the exact
location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this at about the time you were being released?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you first got the signal to go to Elm and Houston, did
he say Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Elm and Houston, that is the location I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long do you feel that it took you to get from where you
were on Main at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I was in the 1800 block of Main Street, eastbound, and I made
a turn and used my siren and red lights, and the maximum amount of time
it could have taken me would be 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you got there in 3 minutes, and within 3 minutes after you
heard the signal you were stopping people from going in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are nodding your head, yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know how many minutes after the shooting you heard the
first notice over the police radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At times you were working away from your police radio while
you were picking up the signs, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes; and you can't hear the radio from a distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you heard this news about this shooting in Oak Cliff&mdash;by
the way, where was your regular station ordinarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I worked west of Vernon on Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that Oak Cliff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes; that is West Jefferson Boulevard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after you heard about the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I got on my motorcycle and I proceeded down through the
triple underpass and up onto R.&nbsp;L. Thornton Freeway to Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I exited off Jefferson and went to the 400 block of East Jefferson
Boulevard and began a search of the two-story house behind 10th Street where
the officer had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. And after we searched this area, I got in the squad car with
Officer Ray Hawkins, who was driving, and Officer Baggett was riding in the
back seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you get inside the squad car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. The clutch on my motorcycle was burned out and I couldn't
get any speed, and I just barely made it over there, and I didn't know whether
I would be able to start and go or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. We proceeded west on 10th Street to Beckley, and we pulled into
the Mobil gas station at Beckley and 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is a Mobil gas station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. And Officer Ray Hawkins and Officer Baggett went inside of the
Mobil gas station. And I am not positive, but I think they used the telephone
to call in.</p>

<p>I am not positive, but I believe they gave us a call for us to call. I mean their
number to call in.</p>

<p>At the time they were in the service station, I heard the dispatcher give a
call that the suspect was just seen running across the lawn at the Oak Cliff
Branch Library at Marsalis and Jefferson.</p>

<p>I reached over and blew the siren on the squad car to attract the officers'
attention, Officers Baggett and Hawkins, and they came running out of the
service station and jumped in the car, and I told them to report to, I can't
remember, Marsalis and Jefferson, the suspect was seen running across the
lawn at the library.</p>

<p>We proceeded south on Beckley to Jefferson, and east on Jefferson to Marsalis,
where we hit the ground and searched the area at the library for the suspect
who was&mdash;a teenager had run across the lawn and into the basement of the
library.</p>

<p>At this time, after we found out that this person wasn't involved, we returned
to the squad car and began to drive west on Jefferson, west on East Jefferson,
and as we approached the 100 block of East Jefferson, the dispatcher said on
the radio, that a suspect was just seen entering the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now the suspect in the library, do you know who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No; I don't. There were several officers at the location, including
some constables from the constable's office in Oak Cliff at Beckley and 12th,
and there were four or five persons that came out from the basement with their
hands over their head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
One of them was a young boy there, and another officer or two checked him.
A sergeant was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that young boy the one that they thought was a suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what the young boy said he was doing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir; I didn't interrogate him or talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you heard about another report on the suspect, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir. Then we left that location as we were proceeding west
on East Jefferson, and as we approached the 100 block of East Jefferson, the
radio dispatcher said that a suspect had just entered the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, prior to that time had there been any recovery of
any items of clothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did that occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. That occurred while we were searching the rear of the house
in the 400 block of East Jefferson Boulevard at the rear of the Texaco station.
Behind cars parked on a lot at this location, a white jacket was picked up by
another officer. I observed him as he picked it up, and it was stated that this
is probably the suspect's jacket. The original description was that he was wearing
a white jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of jacket was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. It looked like a white cloth jacket to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it the zipper type?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I didn't see it that close. I was approximately 25 yards away
from the officer who picked it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, go ahead, continue with your story. You heard about
the suspect going into the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I told Officer Hawkins to drive west on Jefferson. He didn't
know the exact location of the Texas Theatre. And from west on Jefferson
to north on South Zangs Boulevard, and to make a left turn to travel west on
West Sunset the wrong direction, which is a one-way street, and then to cut
back in across the parking lot at the rear of the theatre to the fire exit doors
at the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. We pulled up to this location and I was the first out of the car
to hit the ground. As I walked up to the fire exit doors, Officer Hawkins and
Baggett were getting out of the car, and the door to the theatre opened, and
this unknown white male was exiting.</p>

<p>I drew my pistol and put it on him and told him to put up his hands and not
to make a move, and he was real nervous and scared and said: "I am not the
one. I just came back to open the door. I work up the street at the shoestore,
and Julia sent me back to open the door so you could get in."</p>

<p>I walked up and searched him briefly and I could see by the description and
his clothes that he wasn't the person we were looking for.</p>

<p>Then I entered the theatre from this door, and Officer Hawkins with me,
and Officer Baggett stayed behind to cover the fire exit door.</p>

<p>We walked down the bottom floor of the theatre, and I was joined there by
Officer Walker by me, and as we walked up the north aisle from the center
section, I observed Officer McDonald walking up the south aisle from the center
section, and we observed two suspects sitting near the front in the center
section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were on the right center or the left center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I was on the left center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be the left center, and McDonald on the right center
aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes; and Officer Walker was with me on the left center aisle.</p>

<p>Officer McDonald and Walker searched these two suspects, had them stand
up and searched them while I covered.</p>

<p>As soon as they were searched&mdash;well, I left out that part about the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
of people sitting in the theatre on the lower floor. When I walked in, I noticed
there were seven people I observed sitting on the lower floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you count them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir; I counted them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, seven people. There were two people you noticed
toward the front of the center section, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then where were the other five?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. There was two sitting in the center section near the front,
and directly behind them, five rows from the back, and three seats over, I
am not sure whether that was the third row&mdash;I put it in my <span class="locked">report&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say you put it in your report. Is that your report dated
December 3, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. The third row from the back and the fifth seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there another person there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. That was another person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. That was Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't know it at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I didn't know who it was; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. And directly behind him sitting against the back of the theatre
was another man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the back of the last row of the center section?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That accounts for four people. Where were the others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. There were two young boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. They were sitting back on the same row as that man, back row.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Right center or left center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. They were sitting in the left as you face the screen, left center
section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, that accounts for six of them, and the only other
people was one person sitting over here to the right side toward the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes; toward the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how many people were upstairs, or didn't
you count?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I couldn't tell, so many people up there, and so many policemen
when I looked up. I don't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened after you saw these two people towards
the front of the center section? Were they searched?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Then I proceeded up the aisle toward the back of the theatre,
and McDonald was walking toward the back of the theatre in the right center
section aisle.</p>

<p>As he approached this person sitting in the same row of seats, he approached
this person. I approached from the row behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You approached from the second row from the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then what did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I saw this person stand up, and McDonald and him became
engaged in a struggle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see who hit whom first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are shaking your head, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. The lights were down. The lights were on in the theatre, but it
was dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Visibility was poor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I saw McDonald down in the seat beside this person, and this
person was in a half standing crouching position pushing down on the left side
of McDonald's face, and McDonald was trying to push him off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This person was right-handed?</p>

<p>You have used a motion here that he was pushing on the left side of McDonald's
face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. And McDonald was trying to hold him off with his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I reached over from the back of the seat with my right arm
and put it around this person's throat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. And pulled him back up on the back of the seat that he was
originally sitting in.</p>

<p>At this time Officer C.&nbsp;T. Walker came up in the same row of seats that the
struggle was taking place in and grabbed this person's left hand and held it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. McDonald was at this time simultaneously trying to hold this
person's right hand.</p>

<p>Somehow this person moved his right hand to his waist, and I saw a revolver
come out, and McDonald was holding on to it with his right hand, and this gun
was waving up toward the back of the seat like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you had your left hand, or was it McDonald's left hand, on
the suspect's right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. McDonald was using both of his hands to hold onto this person's
right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. And the gun was waving around towards the back of the seat,
up and down, and I heard a snapping sound at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of snapping sound was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Sounded like the snap of a pistol, to me, when a pistol snaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know which way the pistol was pointing when you heard
the snap?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Was pointing toward the back of the seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was pointing toward the back of the seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes; toward the screen in the front of the theatre, in that
direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Wait a minute, now. Toward the screen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Toward the front of the theatre, or the back of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Toward the front of the theatre, we will call, facing the screen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it aiming at anyone in particular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No; not any officer in particular. The only one that could have
came in the line of fire was Officer Ray Hawkins, who was walking up in the
row of seats in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any people say anything? Did you hear the suspect
say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I don't remember hearing anybody say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear Officer McDonald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are shaking your head no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. The gun was taken from the suspect's hand by Officer McDonald
and somebody else. I couldn't say exactly. They were all in on the struggle,
and Officer Hawkins, in other words, he simultaneously, we decided to handcuff
him.</p>

<p>We had restrained him after the pistol was taken, but he was still resisting
arrest, and we stood him up and I let go of his neck at this time and took hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of his right arm and attempted to bring it back behind him, and Officer Hawkins
and Walker and myself attempted to handcuff him.</p>

<p>At this time Sgt. Jerry Hill came up and assisted as we were handcuffing.</p>

<p>Then Captain Westbrook came in and gave the order to get him out of here
as fast as you can and don't let anybody see him, and he was rushed out of
the theatre.</p>

<p>I was in the row of seats behind. I saw Officer Walker and Sgt. Jerry Hill
had ahold of him, and that is the last I ever saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see him down at the police station thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir; I never did see him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How do you know this was Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. After we finished up in the theatre, I went downtown and
went into the office where they were writing up the report, and to tell them
the part I took in the arrest of him, to get the information, and at this time
they had his name, Lee Harvey Oswald, but all we knew is, he was probably the
suspect that shot the officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the theatre did you know that he had any connection with
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did the police stop hitting him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I never did ever see them hit him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You never saw any police hit him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can think of about this incident
that you haven't related here?</p>

<p>While you are thinking about it, I am going to get a piece of clothing here for
a minute and I will be back.</p>

<p>Anything else, Officer, you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I can't think of anything else right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am showing you Commission Exhibit 162, which appears to
be a jacket with a zipper. Does that look like the jacket you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. That looks like the jacket that was picked up by the officer
behind the Texaco service station, behind the cars parked on the lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far were you from the officer when he picked it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Approximately 25 yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear what he said when he picked it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I heard something&mdash;someone make the statement that that
looks like the suspect's jacket. He has thrown it down. He is not wearing
it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is this Texaco station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. It is in the 400 block of East Jefferson at the intersection. It is
on the northeast corner of the intersection of Crawford and Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far north of Jefferson would this jacket have been when
it was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. One-half block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know the name of the officer that found it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened to the jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. The last time I saw this jacket, the officer had it in his
possession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who he gave it to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know if he gave it to Captain Westbrook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I don't know. Captain Westbrook was there behind the house
with us, and he was there at the time this was picked up with the man, but I don't
know who had it in their hands. The only time I saw it was when the officer
had it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Showing you Commission Exhibit 150, have you ever seen this
before, or not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. It looks like the shirt that the person was wearing that we
arrested in the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer, you have the right, if you want, to come back and read
your deposition and sign it, or you can waive the signing and let the court
reporter send it to us directly in Washington. Do you desire to do either one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. I will go ahead and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The court reporter can get in touch with you at the Dallas Police
Department, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We want to thank you very much for your cooperation, and please
convey my thanks to your sergeant or captain, whoever is in charge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutson</span>. All right, nice to have seen you all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I came back to Grand Prairie and went to work there and
worked there 5½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Doing what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Aircraft mechanic and electrical work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I came to work for the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. 1959, July the 27th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you have been there ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you state where you were on duty around 12 or 12:30 or so
on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I was at Jefferson and Tenth Street at the fire station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that in the Oak Cliff section there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were you doing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I was cruising the area and I had heard on the radio about the
disturbance downtown, so I checked out at the fire station. I didn't check
out. I just stopped and went in and listened to the news broadcast to find out
in more detail what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you cruising alone at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is it general procedure for officers cruising in the daytime to work
alone or in pairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Accident investigations, we work alone. That is day and night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Day and night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about nonaccident investigation? Do you know offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Radio patrol work, one man during the day. Second and third
platoon, they work two men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be the second platoon would come to work about
4 in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you know Officer J.&nbsp;D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Ever work with him at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I believe I have. I can't recall. I worked at the same substation
he did before I transferred downtown, and I knew him quite well. I
talked to him. He worked at Austin, and I have talked to him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let's leave Officer Tippit for the moment and return to the
fire station. You were there and you say you called in around shortly after
you heard the news?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes. I went directly there. I was about a block away or
might have been in the block I don't recall exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean a block away from the fire station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do when you called in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I didn't call in. I just went in there and looked. They have
a television there, and they broadcast that the President had been shot.</p>

<p>I had my radio up so I could hear from the door, and I went back out to
my car. They were sending squads downtown, Code 3.</p>

<p>And I don't recall, I don't believe they actually sent me. I just went on
my own because they normally don't send us in this type of call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you went on your own where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I went to the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is at Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you park your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Right in front of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after you got your car parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Went inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go inside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I went right inside the front doors there and the hallway there
and I stayed in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, there was squads of police upstairs supposedly searching
the building out, and someone said they have enough upstairs, so I didn't go
upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you were downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. We were checking persons as they came in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you keep people from coming in or going out, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. We didn't let anyone in or out except policemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how soon after you saw the telecast do you think you got
down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the building sealed off at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone tell you when they got it sealed off, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I heard that an officer had been killed in Oak Cliff, had been
shot, and I got back in my car and started off. A newsman ran up to the
window and said, "Can I ride with you," and I let him get in the car and I
went to Oak Cliff and 10th Street, and drove by the scene.</p>

<p>In fact, there was two newspapermen, but one got out at the scene where
Officer Tippit was killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Officer Tippit's car still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; it was still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any recollection&mdash;did you take a look at the car
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I didn't really look real close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to any witnesses there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I didn't get out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I started up cruising the area, and I went up the street that
runs north and south and faces the, runs into the library at Jefferson and
Marsalis, and I saw a white male running east across the lawn of the library.</p>

<p>I was still approximately three-fourths of the block from Jefferson, and he
was even south of Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far would he have been from you then when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. He was over a block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I put out a broadcast on the air that there was a person fitting
the description on the air that was seen running in front of the library, and I
gave the location and said I will be around at the back. I ran around to the
back of the library and other squads then surrounded the library.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were not the one that put out the first description of the
suspect they sought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I didn't. The newspaperman was still with me at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was the description, if you remember, over the radio as
to what you were looking for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. A white male, slender build, and had on a light-colored coat
or shirt, and that is the best I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. About 30 years old, I think he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do? Did you go into the library?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. As soon as the squads got there, I walked around with the
other squads to the west entrance of the building, and we ordered everyone out
of the building. They all came out with their hands up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this the upstairs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; it is the downstairs. You had to go downstairs to get to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Something like a basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes. It is a semibasement, I would call it. And everyone
came out, and I saw the person that had run in there, and he said that he had
ran there to tell the other people about the shooting. And let's see, that he
worked there, he told me he worked there and everything. I soon determined
he wasn't the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I got back in my car and started cruising the area again. I
went up and down the alleys and streets. And there was one incident that really
didn't have anything to do with it. I guess I was cruising up the alley with
the newspaperman in the car, and I saw a man in long white sleeves, white
shirt, walking across the parking lot there of the church, and I couldn't see below
his legs, and there was a picket fence there, and when he got about 30 feet
from me, I stopped the car, and he was walking toward me, and I had my gun
in my lap at the time, and I said, "What is your name?" And he just looked
at me. And at that time I didn't know whether he had a rifle or what he had,
and he just looked at me, and he bent over, and I stuck my gun in the window
and he raised up and had a small dog and he said, "What did you say?" And of
course that newspaperman said, "My God, I thought he was going to shoot us."</p>

<p>I said, "I thought he was reaching down for a rifle."</p>

<p>Of course, he reached down and picked up a little dog.</p>

<p>Then we got around to Beckley and 10th Street, still cruising the area, when
I heard the call come over the radio that the suspect was supposed to be at the
theatre on Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Texas Theatre; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I went in the alley up to the back door. When I arrived there,
there was several officers there. There was a plainclothesman up on the ladder
back there. I don't know what he was doing up there, but he was up on the
ladder that goes up that door that is in the back. And there were several officers
around the back of the theatre, and myself, and McDonald, and Officer
Hutson went in the back door. And this man told us, or this boy told us that
there was someone, said the person that he had seen was inside the theatre,
and that he had changed seats several times, and he thought he was out there
in the middle now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say that he had seen him? Did he tell you what he had
seen him do, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. He said he seen him duck into the store where he worked, kind
of looked back, and looked like he was running, and just run into the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say why he seemed to duck in the store at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; he didn't. He said he looked like he was scared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then do you remember this man's name that you talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; it was just for a second, and I went on past him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, this was at the back of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone have a gun drawn when this man came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I had my gun out. I had my gun out when I walked in the
back of the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have your gun as you continued walking through the
back of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I walked&mdash;McDonald and I walked across the stage, and he walked
across the farthest away. It would be the south aisle. And I jumped off
there where the north aisle runs east and west, and we started up. Hutson
went down the steps in front of both of us, and he was slightly in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are speaking about Officer T.&nbsp;A. Hutson and Officer M.&nbsp;N.
McDonald and yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The three of you came in from the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; and there were probably a couple more, but I just don't
remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Those are the three you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now as you faced the screen, were you going up the right center
or the left center aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. As I faced the screen, I would be going up the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it the left center aisle or was it the far left aisle that you
were going up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Be the far left aisle, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Next to the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; there is no aisle exactly against the wall. There is a row
of seats, and then an aisle, and the middle aisle, and then another row of seats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you would be in the aisle, as you faced the screen, which
would be to the left of the center row of seats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay; just tell what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. There were two white males sitting approximately in the center
of the show. The lights had come on, and I don't know at what point they
come on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how many people was seated down on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. There were two in the middle, and then there was Oswald,
who turned out to be Oswald&mdash;I didn't know at that time it was him&mdash;and two
behind him, I believe. I think there was one in the aisle, in the seats to the
right of the right aisle. I don't know how you describe it, south of the south
aisle, what I call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were coming up the north aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. And this other person was sitting over on the other side of
the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you recall then a total of six people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That is all I recall seeing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The people behind the man that you later found out to be
Oswald, how far were they behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. They were about three or four or five seats behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what row were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I believe they were in the last row, or maybe the next to the
last.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What row was Oswald in, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. The best I recall, fourth or fifth aisle from me, from the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Fourth or fifth row from the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, you mentioned there were two people sitting
together in the center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You came up and approached those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. McDonald approached them from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Right center aisle, and I approached from the left center aisle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have your gun drawn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I had it drawn, and I put it back in my holster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I had to search him. As I got up to him, we had him stand
up and we searched him with their hands up, and I had my gun in the holster.
I searched the one on the left, and McDonald searched the one on the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you looking at other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I looked around. Of course, I didn't recognize anybody. I didn't
know who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I walked back up to the aisle that I had been going down, and
McDonald walked out the aisle he had been walking down, and we approached
the aisle where Oswald was sitting. McDonald approached him from his aisle,
and Hutson, which was in front of me on the same aisle, had started in
the seat toward Oswald, in the seat that runs behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the row of seats that ran behind him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. And he started down that way, and I was walking toward him
slightly behind him in the same row of seats that Oswald was sitting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you approached Oswald from Oswald's left, and McDonald
approached Oswald from Oswald's right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Oswald sitting closer to McDonald, or you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Closer to McDonald. He was sitting in the third seat from
McDonald's aisle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. McDonald approached him, and he said, I don't know exactly, I
assumed he said, "Stand up!" And Oswald stood up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear Oswald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Oswald facing you as he stood up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; he faced McDonald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. He put his hand up, not exactly as you would raise your
hands to be searched, but more or less showing off his muscles, what I call
it, kind of hunching his shoulders at the same time, and McDonald put his hand
down to Oswald's pocket, it looked like to me, and McDonald's head was tilted
slightly to the right, looking down in the right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Looking in whose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. McDonald's right hand as he was searching, and he felt of
his pocket, and Oswald then hit him, it appeared, with his left hand first, and
then with his right hand. They was scuffling there, and Officer Hutson and I
ran toward the back of Oswald and Hutson threw his arm around his neck, and
I grabbed his left arm, and we threw him back over the seat.</p>

<p>At this time I didn't see any gun that was involved. I don't know whether
we pulled Oswald away from McDonald for a split second or what, but he was
thrown back against the seat, and then the next thing I saw, Oswald's hand was
down on the gun in his belt there, and McDonald had came forward again and
was holding his, Oswald's hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you saw Oswald's hand by his belt, which hand did you see
by his belt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I saw his right hand. I had his left hand, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you saw Oswald's hand by his belt, which hand did you see
then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. He had ahold of the handle of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handle of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. The revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there a revolver there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. And it stayed there for a second or two. He didn't get it out.
McDonald had come forward and was holding his hand.</p>

<p>Ray Hawkins was behind me to my left at that time, and whether or not he
came at the same time we did or not, but he was there, and there was a
detective.</p>

<p>Oswald had ahold of my shirt and he practically pulled off my nameplate by
gripping it with his hand, and I was bent over, and I was in an awkward position,
and I could see several hands on the gun.</p>

<p>The gun finally got out of his belt, and it was about waist high and pointed
out at about a 45° angle.</p>

<p>I turned around and I was holding Oswald trying to get his arm up behind him
in a hammerlock, and I heard it click. I turned around and the gun was still
pointing at approximately a 45° angle. Be pointed slightly toward the screen,
what I call.</p>

<p>Now Hawkins was in the general direction of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you heard a click, what kind of click was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. A real light click, real light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it a click of the seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, I assume it was a click of a revolver on the shell, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
that is when the gun was doing the most moving around. It was moving
around in the general area, and they were still fighting. And some one said,
"Let go of the gun," and Oswald said, "I can't."</p>

<p>And a detective, I don't recall who it was, there were so many people around
by that time, the area was bursting with policemen, and it appeared to me that
he reached over and pulled the gun away from everybody, pulled it away from
everyone, best I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay, what happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Ray Hawkins was on my left. He said, "Bring his arm around,"
and said, "I have the handcuffs."</p>

<p>He said, "Bring his arm around so I can get the cuffs on him."</p>

<p>I finally got his left arm around and I snapped the cuffs on it, and Hawkins
went over the seat there and picked up, someone pulled his right arm around
there, and Hawkins snapped the handcuffs on him, and turned him around and
faced him, Oswald, north.</p>

<p>And Detective Bentley got on his left arm and I took his right arm, and we
went out the aisle that I, which would be the left aisle, that I had came in,
with Oswald, and walked him out the front.</p>

<p>He was hollering, "I protest this police brutality."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Let me ask you this. What is the fact as to whether
you had seen police officers hitting Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. The only person I saw was McDonald. They were exchanging
blows, and if he actually came in contact. He was to my back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone other than McDonald hit Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hit Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Hutson hit Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, go ahead. Did Oswald say, "I am not resisting arrest"?
Do you remember him saying that at all, or don't you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. The only thing he said later, I know, was, "I fought back there,
but I know I wasn't supposed to be carrying a gun."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In any event, you brought him down the lobby of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. When we went out the front door, he started hollering, "I protest
this police brutality."</p>

<p>People out there were hollering, "Kill the s.o.b." "Let us have him. We want
him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At that time, did anyone connect him with the assassination of the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Not unless the crowd had assumed that is who we were after,
I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you were after him, you were after him for what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. For the killing of Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. There was a plain car, police car out in front. The right door
was open, and Bentley went in first, and Oswald come and then I. We sat in
the back seat with him.</p>

<p>Sgt. Jerry Hill in the front, and two more detectives that I don't know who
they were, that rode down, too.</p>

<p>There were five officers and Oswald in the car. We took him down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any conversation take place? First of all, anything up until the
time you got in the car that you think is important in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Not that I recall, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you got in the car and went down to the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. As we were driving down there, yes; he <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Oswald said, "What is this all about?" He was relating this all
the time. He said, "I know my rights." That is what he was saying, "I know
my rights."</p>

<p>And we told him that the police officer, that he was under arrest because the
police officer, he was suspected in the murder of a police officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
And he said, "Police officer been killed?"</p>

<p>And nobody said nothing. He said, "I hear they burn for murder."</p>

<p>And I said, "You might find out."</p>

<p>And he said, "Well, they say it just takes a second to die."</p>

<p>And that is all I recall.</p>

<p>Now we talked some more going down, but that is the thing that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you recall any other conversation that you had with him,
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; he was just denying it, and he was saying that all he did
was carry a gun, and the reason he fought back in the theatre is, he knew he
wasn't supposed to be carrying a gun, and he had never been to jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything about why he was at the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say why he was carrying the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what clothes he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. He had on a white T-shirt under a brown shirt, and a pair of
black pants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How would you describe Oswald? About how tall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. About 5'8" about 150 pounds, or 155 pounds, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I would say sandy, the best I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sandy, by that, you mean blond?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Darker than blonde. I just don't recall this for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Some shade of brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. It wasn't what you call blond. It was darker than blond, in my
opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it some shade of brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes; the best I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about him on your way to the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. He was real calm. He was extra calm. He wasn't a bit excited
or nervous or anything. That was all the conversation I can recall going down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you got down there, what did you do with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. We took him up the homicide and robbery bureau, and we went
back there, and one of the detectives said put him in this room.</p>

<p>I put him in the room, and he said, "Let the uniform officers stay with him."
And I went inside, and Oswald sat down, and he was handcuffed with his hands
behind him.</p>

<p>I sat down there, and I had his pistol, and he had a card in there with a picture
of him and the name A.&nbsp;J. Hidell on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what kind of card it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Just an identification card. I don't recall what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. And I told him, "That is your real name, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He&mdash;had he earlier told you his name was Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I believe he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. And he said, "No, that is not my real name."</p>

<p>And I started talking to him and I asked him, I said, "Why did you kill the
officer?"</p>

<p>And he just looked at me. And I said, "Did you kill the officer because you
were scared of being arrested for something?"</p>

<p>And he said, "I am not ascared of anything. Do I look like I am scared now?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he look like he was scared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; he didn't look like he was scared. He was calm. Not a bit
nervous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any other thing that you can remember that took place during that
time that he was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I can't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you asked ever to make a report of any conversation you had
with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; they called me on the phone a couple of days after, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
supervisor asked me, there had been a rumor got out that Oswald had said,
"Well, I got me a President and a cop. I should have got me two more." Or
something like that.</p>

<p>But that conversation was never said, because I was with him from the time
that he was arrested until the time the detectives took him over.</p>

<p>I made a written report on the arrest about a week after it happened, and that
is the only conversation I had with anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In that report you didn't put any conversation that Oswald had,
did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I didn't put any conversation. I just put the details of the
arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you asked just to make a report on your arrest of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That is normal procedure, just what we call a "Dear Chief"
letter.</p>

<p>Just describe the arrest and other officers involved, and we never did put what
conversation we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that Oswald said in your presence, or that you said
to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At any time prior to the time you left him, did you find out he was
a suspect in the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. When I got to the jail office and talk was going there that he
was the suspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ask him any questions about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No; I didn't tie him in at that time with the actual killing of
the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you can think of now that might be relevant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now we chatted a little bit at the beginning prior to this deposition,
and you said that you knew Officer Tippit, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long had you known Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Ever since I have been on the police department. When I
first came to work, I was assigned to the Oak Cliff substation and worked there
until I went to traffic investigation, and he was there all the time.</p>

<p>I am sure I worked with him when I first started out and was training and
stuff like that. But I had worked with him prior to his death for, I know,
maybe 2 or 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now at the time of the Tippit shooting, there had been no call for
Lee Harvey Oswald as an individual, although there was a call for&mdash;I mean
there was an announcement of a general description of the suspect in the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Just from your knowledge of the way Tippit operated, do you
have any reason to think whether that general call might have affected his
perhaps stopping this man on the street at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I believe the type of officer Tippit was, that he was suspicious
of him as a suspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why do you believe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, Officer Tippit was an exceptional officer. He made good
arrests. It was known around the station that he was exceptionally good
with investigative work and just general police work. He was above normal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why do you think he stopped this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I believe that the description given on the radio, that he probably
stopped just to check him out as a general procedure, as we do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, if he stopped him for that reason, this man, he would have
stopped him because the man was a suspect for perhaps the assassination, why
wouldn't he have had his gun out when he stopped him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Well, there are a lot of people of that description, and it is
just not police practice to pull your gun on a person because he fits the description
of someone, unless you are positive almost that it is the suspect. You
just don't do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you, did you have anything to do on November 22, or
anything more to do on November 22, with either the Tippit shooting or investigation
or apprehension of Oswald or the assassination of the President's
investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No. I stayed down in Captain Westbrook's office for a while
until I got off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How about November 23, did you have anything to do that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. That would have been Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Or did you work on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, I worked on Saturday. I didn't follow up on any investigation
of any kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you going back to accident investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes, I went back to the accident investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't have anything to do with anything connected with the
assassination after November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything that we haven't covered here that you can
think of at this time, Officer Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Not that I can think of. It's been a long time, and I just
don't recall. I think there was more conversation with Oswald, but I can't
recall all of it. I just remember what I considered the high points of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever ask for a lawyer in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I don't recall. I think he said&mdash;I know he was repeating, "I
know my rights." I don't recall him actually asking for a lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say where he got the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. No, he didn't say where he got the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he admit that it was his gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Never did ask him actually whether it was his gun. He said
he knew he was carrying a gun and he wasn't supposed to, so I assumed it was
his gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we certainly appreciate your taking the time to come down
here to testify before us, and we want to thank you very much for your
cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Okay. I know you've got a problem here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have I asked you whether or not you care to read the deposition?
I don't believe I have. You have an opportunity here to either read the
deposition and then sign it, or else waive the signing of it and have the court
reporter, Helen Laidrich, send it directly to us in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I will go ahead and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, Miss Laidrich will get in touch with you at the Dallas
Police Department, I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Yes. Do you want me to sign it now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am talking about when she gets it typed up. Do you want to
read it or have her send it to us directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Do I have to come, down here to read it here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, you have to come down and read it here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. I will come down and read it and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, fine. Thank you, sir.</p>

<h2 id="t43">TESTIMONY OF GERALD LYNN HILL</h2>

<p>The testimony of Gerald Lynn Hill was taken at 4:15 p.m., on April 8, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant, would you stand and raise your right hand, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Sergeant, could you please state your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Gerald Lynn Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Sergeant in the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Since March 7, 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you, Sergeant Hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Thirty-four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Ferris, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to school there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; I went to school in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you get through school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Went through high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do when you got out of high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Went to work for the Dallas Times Herald. Worked there from
January of 1948 until April of 1954.</p>

<p>At the time I resigned there, I was radio-television editor for the paper.</p>

<p>Went from there to the Dallas Bureau of WBAP-TV in Fort Worth, and
worked for them until March the 21st, 1958.</p>

<p>The last 2 weeks I was working for them, I was attending the police academy
for the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I went with the police prior to quitting. I turned in my notice
with WBAP and they let me work it out while I attended the police school,
because I was actually hired on a Saturday, and the police school started on
Monday, and I wanted to leave on good terms with one place and start to school
on time with the other, so they worked out an agreement with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I was on special assignment, detached from the police patrol
division, and assigned to the police personnel office investigating applicants
for the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. On that particular day, I was at the city hall in the personnel office,
and did not have an assignment of any kind pertaining to the President's trip
or any other function other than the investigation of police applicants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you leave the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The President had passed the corner of Commerce or&mdash;excuse me,
Main and Harwood, turned off Harwood onto Main, and proceeded west on
Main.</p>

<p>I had watched it from the personnel office window, which is on the third
floor of the police and courts building, and Capt. W.&nbsp;R. Westbrook, who was
my commander, had apparently been on the streets watching the parade, and
he came back in and we were discussing some facts about how fast it passed
and the police unit in it, and we had seen the chief's car in it, and how Mrs.
Kennedy was dressed, and we were sitting in the office when a lady by the
name of Kemmey, I believe is the way she spelled it, came in and said that the
President had been shot at Main and Lamar.</p>

<p>Our first reaction was one of disbelief, but a minute later&mdash;she just made the
statement and walked out&mdash;and a minute later Captain Westbrook said, "She
wasn't kidding."</p>

<p>And I said, "When she you mean?"</p>

<p>And he said, "When she is kidding, she can't keep a straight face."</p>

<p>And figuring it was true, the dispatcher's office would be packed to the gills,
so I walked down to the far end of the hall on the third floor where there
is an intercom box connected to the radio from the dispatcher's office, and also
you can hear the field side of the intercom of anything that is said to the police
radio, and this is down in the press room.</p>

<p>I stood there for a minute and I heard a voice which I am almost sure was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Inspector Sawyer&mdash;but being I didn't see a broadcast, I couldn't say for sure&mdash;saying
we think we have located the building where the shots were fired from at
Elm and Houston Streets, and send us some help.</p>

<p>At this time I went back to the personnel office and told the captain that
Inspector Sawyer requested assistance at Elm and Houston Streets. The
captain said, "Go ahead and go."</p>

<p>And he turned to another man in the office named Joe Fields and told him to
get on down there.</p>

<p>I got on the elevator on the third floor and went to the basement and saw
a uniformed officer named Jim M. Valentine, and I asked Jim what he was
doing, and he said, "Nothing in particular."</p>

<p>And I said, "I need you to take me down to Elm Street."</p>

<p>"The President has been shot."</p>

<p>We started out of the basement to get in his car, and a boy named Jim E. Well,
with the Dallas Morning News, had parked his car in the basement and was
walking up and asked what was going on, and we told him the President was
shot.</p>

<p>And he said, "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>And we said, "Down to Elm and Houston where they think the shots came
from."</p>

<p>And he said, "Could I go with you?"</p>

<p>So we took him in the back seat of the car. And I don't remember what the
number was.</p>

<p>We came out of the basement on Commerce, went to Central, turned left, went
over on Elm, ran into a traffic jam on Elm, went down as far as Pearl Street
and turned back to the left on Pearl and went to Jackson Street, went west on
Jackson to Houston Street, and turned back to the right and pulled up in front
of the Book Depository at Elm and Houston, jumped out of the car and Inspector
Sawyer was there.</p>

<p>I asked him did he have enough men outside to cover the building properly,
and he said, "Yes; I believe so."</p>

<p>And I said, "Are you ready for us to go in and shake it down?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Yes, let's go in and check it out."</p>

<p>About this time Captain Fritz and two or three more detectives from homicide,
a boy named Roy Westphal, who works for the special service bureau, and a
couple of uniformed officers, and a couple of deputy sheriffs came up.</p>

<p>Now you identified them to me the other day, the two boys that were on
the sixth floor from the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think when we chatted briefly the other day, I believe I said
Boone and Mooney. Does that sound familiar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I wouldn't know, but I know they identified themselves to us as
deputy sheriffs, and some more people knew them.</p>

<p>So we went into the building, and Captain Fritz and his men said they would
start at the first floor and work up, and they asked several of us to go to the
top floor and work down.</p>

<p>We went up to the seventh floor on the elevator and I believe the elevator
ran to the sixth, and we cut around the stairway and got to seven and shook
it down.</p>

<p>At this time there were the two deputy sheriffs and I and one uniformed
officer up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went to the top floor of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not the elevator went all the way up,
or did you climb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think we climbed a flight of stairs. In fact, I am almost sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you think you climbed a flight of stairs because the elevator
went no further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think it either went to fifth or sixth, but I am almost positive
it didn't go to seventh. I may be wrong, but I didn't particularly take notice.</p>

<p>But I think they told us we were going to have to walk up a couple of flights
because the elevator didn't go all the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you take this elevator?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Walked in the front door of the Book Depository and turned to the
right. Took the passenger elevator. We did not take the freight elevator. The
freight elevator goes all the way, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You took a passenger elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got off the passenger elevator, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We asked them where the stairway was to the top floor, and if
this was on the fifth, we walked through&mdash;there is a little office section near the
elevator. We walked over past it and through a large room to the stairway,
and then went all the way as high as the stairway would take us, which
would have been on seven.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor on the seventh floor there was a ladder leading up
into an area they called the penthouse, which was used mainly for storage.</p>

<p>Westphal went up this ladder, I know, and the uniformed officer went up it.</p>

<p>The rest of us were checking around the boxes and books.</p>

<p>So on file we verified that there was not anyone on the seventh floor, and we
didn't find any indication that the shots had been fired from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Left the uniformed officer there, and these two deputies and I went
down to sixth.</p>

<p>I started to the right side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say the right side, you <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, it would have been the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, they moved over to the east side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We hadn't been there but a minute until someone yelled, "Here it
is," or words to that effect.</p>

<p>I moved over and found they had found an area where the boxes had been
stacked in sort of a triangle shape with three sides over near the window.</p>

<p>Two small boxes with Roller books on the side of the carton were stacked near
the east side of the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let's talk about which window now, sir. First of all, what side
of the building? Was it on the north, east, south, or west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It would have been on the south side near the east wall. It would
have been the window on the southeast corner of the building facing south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it have been the first window next to the east wall or the
second window, or what, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As near as I can remember, it was the first window next to the
east wall, but here again it is&mdash;I stayed up there such a short time that&mdash;yes,
that is the one I am going to have to say it was, because as near as I can
remember, that is the one it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There was the boxes. The boxes were stacked in sort of a three-sided
shield.</p>

<p>That would have concealed from general view, unless somebody specifically
walked up and looked over them, anyone who was in a sitting or crouched position
between them and the window. In front of this window and to the left or east
corner of the window, there were two boxes, cardboard boxes that had the words
"Roller books," on them.</p>

<p>On top of the larger stack of boxes that would have been used for concealment,
there was a chicken leg bone and a paper sack which appeared to have been
about the size normally used for a lunch sack. I wouldn't know what the sizes
were. It was a sack, I would say extended, it would probably be 12 inches high,
10 inches long, and about 4 inches thick.</p>

<p>Then, on the floor near the baseboard or against the baseboard of the south
wall of the building, in front of the second window, in front of the, well, we
would have to say second window from the east corner, were three spent shells.</p>

<p>This is actually the jacket that holds the powder and not the slug. At this
point, I asked the deputy sheriff to guard the scene, not to let anybody touch
anything, and I went over still further west to another window about the middle
of the building on the south side and yelled down to the street for them to send
us the crime lab. Not knowing or not getting any indication from the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
that they heard me, I asked the deputies again to guard the scene and I would
go down and make sure that the crime lab was en route.</p>

<p>When I got toward the back, at this time I heard the freight elevator moving,
and I went back to the back of the building to either catch the freight elevator or
the stairs, and Captain Fritz and his men were coming up on the elevator.</p>

<p>I told him what we found and pointed out the general area, pointed out the
deputies to them, and told him also that I was going to make sure the crime
lab was en route.</p>

<p>About the time I got to the street, Lieutenant Day from the crime lab was
arriving and walking up toward the front door. I told him that the area we had
found where the shots were fired from was on the sixth floor on the southeast
corner, and that they were guarding the scene so nobody would touch anything
until he got there. And he said, "All right."</p>

<p>And he went on into the building, and I went over to tell Inspector Sawyer,
who was standing almost directly in front of the building across the little service
drive there at what would actually be Elm and Houston. About this time I saw
a firetruck come up, but I didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>I was talking to Inspector Sawyer, telling him what we found, when Sgt. C.&nbsp;B.
Owens of Oak Cliff&mdash;he was the senior sergeant out there that day, and actually
acting lieutenant&mdash;came up and wanted to know what we wanted him to do, being
that he had been dispatched to the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me stop you right there. Who dispatched him to the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Apparently the dispatcher. Now his call number that day could
have been 19.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay, go ahead, Sergeant Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We were standing there with Inspector Sawyer and Assistant District
Attorney Bill Alexander came up to us, and we had been standing there for
a minute when we heard the strange voice on the police radio that said something
to the effect that, if I remember right, either the first call that came out
said that they were in the 400 block of East Jefferson, and that an officer had
been shot, and the voice on the radio, whoever it was, said he thought he was
dead.</p>

<p>At this point Sergeant Owens said something to the effect that this would
have been one of his men. And prior, on our way to the location from the
city hall, a description had been broadcast of a possible suspect in the
assassination.</p>

<p>With the description, as I remember, it was a white male, 5'8", 160 pounds,
wearing a jacket, a light shirt, dark trousers, and sort of bushy brown hair.
Captain Sawyer said, "Well, as much help as we have here, why don't you go with
Sergeant Owens to Oak Cliff on that detail." And Bill Alexander said, "Well, if
it is all right, I will go with you." And the reporter, Jim Ewell, came up, and I
said an officer had been shot in Oak Cliff, and he wanted to go with us also.</p>

<p>In the process of getting the location straight, and I think it was at this
point I was probably using 19 call number, because I was riding with him, we
got the information correctly that the shooting had actually been on East 10th,
and we were en route there.</p>

<p>We crossed the Commerce Street viaduct and turned, made a right turn to
go under the viaduct on North Beckley to go up to 10th Street. As we passed,
just before we got to Colorado on Beckley, an ambulance with a police car
behind it passed us en route to Methodist Hospital.</p>

<p>We went on to the scene of the shooting where we found a squad car parked
against the right or the south curb on 10th Street, with a pool of blood on the
left-hand side of it near the side of the car.</p>

<p>Tippit had already been removed. The first man that came up to me, he said,
"The man that shot him was a white male about 5'10", weighing 160 to 170
pounds, had on a jacket and a pair of dark trousers, and brown bushy hair."</p>

<p>At this point the first squad rolled up, and that would have been squad 105,
which had been dispatched from downtown. An officer named Joe Poe, and I believe
his partner was a boy named Jez.</p>

<p>I told him to stay at the scene and guard the car and talk to as many witnesses
as they could find to the incident, and that we were going to start checking
the area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, let me interrupt you here, sergeant. Do you remember the
name of the person that gave you the description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No. I turned him over to Poe, and I didn't even get his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had anyone at anytime given you any cartridge cases of any
kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; they had not. This came much later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go ahead if you would, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All right, I took the key to Poe's car. Another person came up,
and we also referred him to Poe, that told us the man had run over into the
funeral home parking lot. That would be Dudley Hughes' parking lot in the
400 block of East Jefferson&mdash;and taken off his jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You turned this man over to Poe, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice in the radio log transcript, which is marked Sawyer
Deposition Exhibit A, that at 1:26 p.m., between 1:26 p.m., and 1:32 p.m.,
there was a call from No. 19 to 531. 531 is your home number, I believe? Your
radio home station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That says, "One of the men here at the service station that saw
him seems to think he is in this block, 400 block East Jefferson, behind his
service station. Give me some more squads over here." "Several squads check
out." Was that you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That was Owens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you calling in at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No. That is Bud Owens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had left Owens' car at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I left Owens' car and had 105 car at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. At this time, about the time this broadcast came out, I went
around and met Owens. I whipped around the block. I went down to the
first intersection east of the block where all this incident occurred, and made
a right turn, and traveled one block, and came back up on Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. And met Owens in front of two large vacant houses on the north
side of Jefferson that are used for the storage of secondhand furniture.</p>

<p>By then Owens had information also that some citizen had seen the man
running towards these houses.</p>

<p>At this time Sergeant Owens was there; I was there; Bill Alexander was
there; it was probably about this time that C.&nbsp;T. Walker, an accident investigator
got there; and with Sergeant Owens and Walker and a couple more officers
standing outside, Bill Alexander and I entered the front door of the house
that would have been to the west&mdash;it was the farthest to the west of the two&mdash;shook
out the lower floor, made sure nobody was there, and made sure that all
the entrances from either inside or outside of the building to the second floor
were securely locked.</p>

<p>Then we went back over to the house next door, which would have been the
first one east of this one, and made sure it was securely locked, both upstairs
and downstairs. There was no particular sign of entry on this building at all.
At this point we came back out to the street, and I asked had Owens received
any information from the hospital on Tippit.</p>

<p>And he said they had just told him on channel 2 that he was dead. I got
back in 105's car, went back around to the original scene, gave him his car
keys back, and left his car there, and at this point he came up to me with
a Winston cigarette package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This was Poe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went back to the Tippit scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went back to 400 East 10th Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right. And Poe showed me a Winston cigarette package that
contained three spent jackets from shells that he said a citizen had pointed
out to him where the suspect had reloaded his gun and dropped these in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
grass, and that the citizen had picked them up and put them in the Winston
package.</p>

<p>I told Poe to maintain the chain of evidence as small as possible, for him
to retain these at that time, and to be sure and mark them for evidence, and
then turn them over to the crime lab when he got there, or to homicide.</p>

<p>The next place I went was, I walked up the street about half a block to a
church. That would have been on the northeast corner of 10th Street in the
400 block, further west of the shooting, and was preparing to go in when there
were two women who came out and said they were employees inside and had
been there all the time. I asked them had they seen anybody enter the church,
because we were still looking for possible places for the suspect to hide. And
they said nobody passed them, nobody entered the church, but they invited
us to check the rest of the doors and windows and go inside if we wanted to.</p>

<p>An accident investigator named Bob Apple was at the location at that time,
and we were standing there together near his car when the call came out that
the suspect had been seen entering the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We both got in Apple's car and went to Jefferson, made a right
on Jefferson, headed west from our location, and pulled up as close to the
front of the theatre as we could. There were already two or three officers
at the location. I asked if it was covered off at the back.</p>

<p>They said, "We got the building completely covered off."</p>

<p>I entered the right or the east most door to the south side of the theatre,
and in the process or in the meantime, from the time we heard the first call
to the time we got to the theatre, the call came on over the radio that the
suspect was believed to be in the balcony.</p>

<p>We went up to the balcony, ran up the stairs, which would have been also
on the east side. And the picture was still on. I remember yelling to either
the manager or the assistant manager or an employee, maybe just an usher,
to turn on as many lights as they could. Went up to the balcony, and Detective
Bentley was up there, and a uniform officer, and here again there was another
deputy sheriff. He was a uniform man.</p>

<p>There were some six people in the balcony, and we checked them out and
none of them appeared to fit the physical description that we had of the man
that shot Tippit.</p>

<p>I went over and opened the fire escape door or fire exit door and stepped out
on the fire escape, and Capt. C.&nbsp;E. Talbert was down on the ground. He said,
"Did you find anything?"</p>

<p>And I said, "Not up here."</p>

<p>He said, "Have you checked the roof?"</p>

<p>There was a ladder leading from the fire escape that goes on up to the top
of the roof, and the deputy sheriff said, "I will get that for you." And he
started up it.</p>

<p>The captain said words to the effect that, "Make sure you don't overlook him
in there." So we went back inside and we didn't find him in the balcony.
We started downstairs and these would have been the west stairs on the west
side of the balcony. About the time I got to the lower floor, I heard a shout
similar to a "I've got him," which came from the lower floor. And I ran
through the west door from the lobby into the downstairs part of the theatre
proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me stop you right there. When you say it is the west door,
as I remember this theatre, the entrance faces to the south, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But then when you walked in, you walked in straight headed
north, and then you had to turn to the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. So once you turned, I went up. That would have made me come
down the north, go up the south stairway to the balcony, and come down the
north stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, you got down to the first floor. As you go in to
face the screen, the right side of the theatre when you are facing the screen,
you are facing roughly east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right side of the theatre would have been south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. South as you face the screen. All right, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. So I went through the north lower door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Came down the north stairway, and the commotion would have
been to my right or just south of the center of the theatre near the back.
Went over, and as I ran to them I saw some officers struggling with a white male.</p>

<p>I reached out and grabbed the left arm of the suspect, and just before I got
to him I heard somebody yell, "Look out, he's got a gun."</p>

<p>I was on the same row with the suspect. The man on the row immediately
behind him was an officer named Hutson. McDonald was on the other side
of the suspect from me in the same aisle.</p>

<p>Two officers, C.&nbsp;T. Walker and Ray Hawkins, were in the row in front of
us holding the suspect from the front and forcing him backwards and down
into the seat. And to McDonald's right reaching over, and I don't recall which
row he was on, was an officer named Bob Carroll. And then Paul Bentley and
K.&nbsp;E. Lyons, who was Carroll's partner, they were both in the special service
bureau, also was there. They came up at various intervals while all this was
going on.</p>

<p>We finally got the man subdued to the point where we had control of him
and his legs pinned and his arms pinned. I said, "Let's handcuff him." And
being that I was working in plainclothes and working in personnel, didn't have
a pair of handcuffs, and I asked Hawkins if he had. And he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>And I said, "Let's get them."</p>

<p>And Hawkins and I handcuffed him while the others held him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You said you were working in plainclothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any hat on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I did have a hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to hand you what I will mark as G.&nbsp;L. Hill Deposition
Exhibit A, and ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; this is a picture that was made about the time when
we were actually putting the handcuffs on the suspect in the theatre. That
may have been a split second before or a split second after, or right as we
completed the putting on of the handcuffs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you recognize any people in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This would have been the suspect [pointing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, the suspect is a man who you can see parts of the profile
from the left side of his face. He appears to be seated or lower than the
others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Lower than the other people in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then there is a person with a hat on to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. To the immediate right of the suspect, and that is me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then there is a man with a cigar who is looking over the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That is Detective Paul Bentley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now there is a person with light-colored hair that appears to
have his <span class="locked">hands&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That would be C.&nbsp;T. Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then there is another person that is in the extreme left-foreground
part of the picture. Do you know who that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Capt. W.&nbsp;R. Westbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then a party with a hat on. Do you know who that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is to the left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then there is, you can barely see maybe a police hat. Is that
anything you can recognize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not from that; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, go ahead, sir.</p>

<p>You say that you and Ray Hawkins handcuffed the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. At about this time Captain Westbrook and a man who was later
in the day identified to me as, I believe his name was Barnett, an FBI <span class="locked">agent&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be Barrett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Bob was identified to me later in the day by Captain Westbrook.
Came in from, I presume they came in from the north fire exit, which would
have actually been coming in from outside, and came over to us, and Captain
Westbrook instructed us to get the man out of there as soon as possible.</p>

<p>And at the same time instructed some of the other uniform officers to stay
there and protect the scene, and call the crime lab. This was the actual scene
where the arrest was made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me stop you right there. Do you know how this FBI agent
happened to be there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I heard later, and&mdash;but not actually to my own knowledge, that he
was riding with Captain Westbrook.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, I don't know this, but I understand he had ridden out
from town with Captain Westbrook, that he was gravitating toward the incident
in Oak Cliff, and had arrived at the theatre just possibly before we came in,
or right after we went in, and was still outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We started moving the suspect down the aisle, which would have
been walking him north to the exit on that side until we got to the aisle that
would have been dividing the center section and the north section of the theatre.</p>

<p>And there we formed a more or less wedge formation with C.&nbsp;T. Walker
in front, Bob Carroll, I believe was on the suspect's left, K.&nbsp;E. Lyons was on
his right, and Paul Bentley and I were to the rear.</p>

<p>I was on the left. I would have been to the suspect's left-rear side.</p>

<p>Paul Bentley would have been to the right-rear side.</p>

<p>At this point this is the first time I remember encountering any newspapermen
or cameras, but as we walked into the lobby there was a man shooting
movies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Movies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was from channel 8, but who he was, I don't know. He was
a short, rather heavy-set fellow with kinky hair. This I remember about him.</p>

<p>We walked the suspect out the right front or the north door. No, wait a
minute, we have lost our directions again. We walked him out the west door
of the theatre into a squad car, which was out front. Some of the officers that
were still outside had the crowd parted back to where nobody got to us or to
the suspect.</p>

<p>But there were shouts at this time from the crowd of, "That is him. We
ought to kill him. String him up. Hang him.", et cetera and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any other calls from the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I can recall. There was quite a bit of confusion, but we
kept moving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me stop you right there. You mentioned that when you were
coming down from the balcony to the first floor, or in the process of going into
the first floor, you heard an officer or someone yell something along the effect,
"I've got him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear anyone else yell or make any other statements?</p>

<p>First, I will ask you this. Did you hear the suspect make any statement
of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not any distinguishable statement that I can specifically recall.
Later in the course of trying to piece this thing together for a report, I believe
it was McDonald and Hutson that stated, and we put it in the report that way,
that the suspect yelled, "This is it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear that with your own ears? That you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; not as a distinguishable specific "This is it," no.</p>

<p>As much confusion and all going on, I didn't distinguish that. Now if we
can back up a little bit to where we made the, got him handcuffed in the theatre,
before we started moving out with him, he started, Oswald or the suspect at this
point, we didn't know who he was, so we will keep on calling him the suspect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
started making statements about "I want a lawyer. I know my rights. Typical
police brutality. Why are you doing this to me."</p>

<p>As as we continued to move him down the aisle out to the aisle dividing the
two sections, out into the lobby of the theatre, he began yelling words similar
to, "Typical police brutality."</p>

<p>And once we got actually outside the door of the theatre, from there to the
period of time that we got to the car, with all the crowd and commotion and
all, I don't recall any further statements of his until we got in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, let me stop there before you testify about getting into
the car. Do you have anything else to add to the statement prior to getting
into the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear the suspect say anything while you were trying to
subdue him, or, "I am not resisting arrest?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I don't recall a statement to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any officer say anything to the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. About the time we got him subdued and handcuffed, I know that
Hutson asked me about did I hear the gun click.</p>

<p>Hutson was the one that was behind him and was pulling him backward, off
balance. He was probably, as near as I could determine from the position, was
probably the second officer to him.</p>

<p>In other words, McDonald made the initial contact, and then Hutson and
then probably Walker and Hawkins with Walker, and then Hawkins, in that
order, getting into the scuffle attempting to subdue him and keep him from
using the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you reply to this question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I told him no. Because apparently this had happened in the
interim from the time of the first yell until I got there, and with the scuffling
of feet, unless you would be right at it, I don't know that you would hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hit the suspect at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone else hit the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No one that I know of. When we got him subdued, he had a
small laceration on the left eyebrow, and what appeared to be a bruise on
the upper-left eyebrow and down along his check, but an actual lick, to see this
done, I did not see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any police officer make any remark such as "Kill
a policeman, will you," or something along that line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; not at this point I didn't. There was a&mdash;you <span class="locked">want&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let's stop there before we get in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There were some statements made in the car similar to this, in
talking about killing a policeman, but I didn't hear any at the time in the theatre
or from the theatre to the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to try to cut off this thing in segments. Did you hear any
policeman make any other statements to him during this scuffle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; everybody was saying, "Look out," and "Get this arm," or
"Watch that leg," or "Make sure you've got a good hold on him."</p>

<p>But as far as any direct quotes to the suspect, or him being called anything
such as a cop killer or statements that you have killed a police officer, you have
killed a cop, or anything of that type, I did not hear any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the suspect hitting any police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Did I see the suspect hitting a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; I did not. I saw his left arm flying about wildly about the
time when I got there. That is what I latched on to, but I didn't actually
identify any direct blows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any movements of the suspect other than the left
arm flailing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was fighting and turning and making an attempt to free himself
of the hold that the officers had on him. As to actually hitting anybody or to
actually seeing the suspect with a gun in his hand, I did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you what has been marked as "G.&nbsp;L. Hill Deposition
Exhibit B." State if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is known to be a picture that was made still inside the theatre
as we were moving down the aisle, I believe, to get him to the aisle that divided
the two sections.</p>

<p>Now specifically, the exact point in the theatre where this was made, I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you recognize anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There are three people in this picture that I recognize. The officer
with the white uniform hat on that is in the foreground looking at the picture,
would be to the left side, is C.&nbsp;T. Walker. The suspect, and what is an open
collar, and what appears to be a T-shirt from here, looking almost directly
at the camera with his face practically covered by the officer's cap, is a man
later identified to us as Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>And the man in the suit looking at the camera with a cigar in his mouth
is Detective Paul Bentley.</p>

<p>There is, to Mr. Bentley's left, part of another officer that is apparently
wearing a suit with only part of his suit and his shirt and his left hand showing.
That cannot be recognized, but I will have to admit I think it is me.</p>

<p>And there is a faint image there, if you get the light&mdash;that is what I am
trying to see&mdash;very faintly&mdash;if we had a&mdash;yes, that is going to be me. What we
need is to get the light in at an angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you hold it a little bit to your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; that is going to be me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who this person is with the helmet at the extreme
left of the person with the helmet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I do not recognize him specifically, but just trying to identify that
much of him, I would say it could be an officer named L.&nbsp;E. Gray, but I can't
make positive identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay, sergeant.</p>

<p>By the way, what is the suspect wearing? You mentioned a T-shirt in the
picture.</p>

<p>Do you remember what else he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He had on a dark&mdash;I don't recall it being a solid brown&mdash;shirt, but
it was a dark-brownish-looking sports shirt, and dark trousers. This I specifically
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; he didn't have a jacket on at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I understand a light-colored jacket was found in the parking lot
of the funeral home, as a man had previously stated, but I don't recall actually
seeing this jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, anything else that anyone else said prior to the time
you got to the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I can recall, sir; other than, as I was saying, as we went
out, the crowd was jeering, making some threats and calling out things.</p>

<p>If at this time the suspect said anything, I didn't hear him.</p>

<p>And we were moving quite rapidly to get him into the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you what has been marked "G.&nbsp;L. Hill Exhibit C,"
I will ask you to state if you know what this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is a picture of the Texas Theatre on West Jefferson, and it
is a picture that I believe was made after we left the location with the suspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Because the car that we left with the suspect in was parked right
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to a position ahead of the Dallas Police Car No.
151, which appears in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that be about the size of the crowd that was there, as
you remember it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The crowd was split up into two groups at that time, on each
side of the theatre entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean by the time you brought the suspect out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; the area immediately in front of the theatre looking to the
car was open at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who opened it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The crowd had been kept back by some officers who had been left
outside to cover off the front of the theatre when the rest of us entered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Apart from the fact that the crowd was split when you led the
suspect out, does this appear to be about the number of people there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir. I would say probably this picture appears to me to contain
75 to 100 people, and I would say probably at the time that we came out
of the theatre, by just glancing on both sides as we moved between the two
groups to the car, I would estimate the crowd was probably about 200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right; anything else up to the time you got to the car that
anyone said or did that you haven't related, that you can remember now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I can recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right; now, let's pick up what happened from the time you
started, with the time you opened the doors of the car to put the suspect in the
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Officer Bentley&mdash;the suspect was put in the right rear door of the
squad car and was instructed to move over to the middle. C.&nbsp;T. Walker got
into the rear seat and would have been sitting on the right rear.</p>

<p>Paul Bentley went around the car and got in the left rear door and sat on
that side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would have been from the left to the right, Bentley, Oswald,
and Walker? Or Bentley, the suspect, and Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. K.&nbsp;E. Lyons got in the right front. I entered the door from the
driver's side and got in the middle of the front seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And being that he had the keys to the car, Bob Carroll drove
the vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As he started to get in the car, he handed me a pistol, which he
identified as the one that had been taken from the suspect in the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did he identify this to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I asked him was this his. He said, "No, it is the suspect's"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did he do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As soon as he handed it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right as I sat down in the car, he apparently had it in his belt,
and as he started to sit down, he handed it to me. I was already in the car and
seated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I am going to hand you what has been marked Commission
Exhibit 143. Would you state if you know what this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is a .38 caliber revolver. Smith &amp; Wesson, with a 2" barrel
that would contain six shells. It is an older gun that has been blue steeled, and
has a worn wooden handle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever seen this gun before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I am trying to see my mark on it to make sure, sir. I don't recall
specifically where I marked it, but I did mark it, if this is the one. I don't
remember where I did mark it, now.</p>

<p>Here it is, Hill right here, right in this crack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer, you have just pointed out a place which I will identify
as a metal portion running along the butt of the gun. Can you describe it any
more fully?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It would be to the inside of the pistol grip holding the gun in the
air. It would begin under the trigger guard to where the last name H-i-l-l is
scratched in the metal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who put that name in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This was done at approximately 4 p.m., the afternoon of Friday,
November 22, 1963, in the personnel office of the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you keep that gun in your possession until you scratched
your name on it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this gun the gun that Officer Carroll handed to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. And identified to me as the suspect's weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is what has now been marked as Commission Exhibit 143,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; that is what it says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It also says the number on this sack in kind of a red ink or
something "C15" on it, too, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It has C15, and on the other side it has 176-G, whatever that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then we have marked Commission Exhibit 143?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you said as the driver of the car, Bob Carroll, got in the
car, he handed this gun to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then, would you tell us what happened? What was
said and what was done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Then I broke the gun open to see how many shells it contained
and how many live rounds it had in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many did you find?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There were six in the chambers of the gun. One of them had an
indention in the primer that appeared to be caused by the hammer. There
were five others. All of the shells at this time had indentions.</p>

<p>All of the shells appeared to have at one time or another scotch tape on
them because in an area that would have been the width of a half inch strip of
scotch tape, there was kind of a bit of lint and residue on the jacket of the
shell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever mark those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I can say that I marked all six of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am first going to hand you what has been marked Q-178
on the lead portion. It is 178 or 170. It appears to be Q-178, with the initials
JH running together and CK, and then another initial R, with a dash behind it.</p>

<p>Do you see any identification mark of yours on there at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; on the side of the jacket of the bullet there is the name
scratched H-i-l-l, and also the initials BC. I scratched the H-i-l-l on this shell,
and Bob Carroll scratched the BC on it in my presence in the personnel office of
the police department on the third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is one of the shells which is a .38 special shell that was removed
from the suspect's weapon, removed from the weapon that was taken
from the suspect at the time of his arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was it removed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They were not taken out of the gun, as I recall, sir, until we
arrived at the station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who took it out of the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I took it out of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you keep it in your possession until you put on your initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All six shells remained in my possession until I initialed them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this an empty shell or live bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That is a live round.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For what caliber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. A .38 caliber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to hand you another bullet which has been marked
Q-177.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That appears to be Q-177.</p>

<p>It's also on the what appears to be the copper tip has the initial JH running
together, the initials CK on it also.</p>

<p>It is a Western .38 special bullet. It has not been fired. It is a copper-colored
slug. On the case of this shell is also the name H-i-l-l, which was placed
there on November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let the record show that I believe that these are Exhibit 145,
but I am not sure. I mean Commission Exhibit 145, and therefore, I identified
them by the "Q" number which is on the bullet itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Was this also something that you took out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This would have been another of the shells, and the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you four more bullets which have been marked as, I believe
they are Commission Exhibit 518, but again I will withhold that identification.</p>

<p>I see the markings on this&mdash;let me see if I can see some "Q" numbers.</p>

<p>I see one Q-79. Do you see that, sergeant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Now that I know where to look, I can find it. It is going to be
Q-79.</p>

<p>It has the initials CK. That is distinguishable on it. It has two X's near
the identification number that are legible.</p>

<p>And it has other markings that is R something or "R-" that is apparently on
some of the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you see your name on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. My name is also on this, on the metal jacket portion of the shell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of bullet is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is another Western .38 special with a copper-colored coating
on the lead inside the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you Q-78.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is a .38 caliber Western shell with the identification mark
Q-78, with the other markings of JH and CK on it, and also on the shell casing
near the rear of the bullet is the name H-i-l-l, with which I marked it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you Q-80.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Okay. This is an R.-P. .38 shell with the identification number
Q-80.</p>

<p>The initials CK and JH near the "Q" number on the jacket of this one. Also
is the name H-i-l-l scratched into the metal, which I placed on it. And this
one also is a plain lead shell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you Q-81, do you see Q-81, on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is an R and P shell with the identification number Q-81, with
the initials CK and JH scratched near the "Q" number.</p>

<p>On the side of this shell also is the word H-i-l-l, which was placed on this
shell by me.</p>

<p>This is a .38 lead slug.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not all of these slugs were removed
from this gun which has been marked as Exhibit 143?</p>

<p>What is the fact as to whether or not all of those six were removed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All six of the slugs that were identified immediately previous to
this point were removed from the gun, identified as Commission Exhibit 143, by
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not from the time this gun was
handed to you until the time you removed these six bullets, this gun was in
your possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The gun remained in my possession until it, from the time it was
given to me until the gun was marked and all the shells were marked. They
remained in my personal possession. After they were marked, they were released
by me to Detective T.&nbsp;L. Baker of the homicide bureau. He came to the
personnel office and requested that they be given to him, and I marked them
and turned them over to him at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, I want to return to the car, Sergeant Hill.</p>

<p>You stated that this gun was handed to you <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Detective Bob Carroll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Detective Bob Carroll when he got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>After he handed you&mdash;handed the gun to you, will you tell us what happened
inside the car, or whether anyone made any remarks? And if you can, what
happened in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We mostly got the car in motion, traveled to the first corner where
we could make a right turn, made a right turn, traveled one block, made another
right turn, continued down this street, and at this point we would have been
going east until we reached Zangs Boulevard, and turned left onto Zangs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Within, I would say seconds&mdash;this is just a guess&mdash;after we got in the car,
I picked up the radio and used the call number 550, car 2, which No. 550 is the
number assigned to the personnel office, and because I knew the captain was out
in the field and he would be using 550, if he got on the radio.</p>

<p>I used call 550, car 2, and made the statement, "We have suspect and weapon
and are en route to the station."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I want to hand you what has been marked Sawyer Deposition
Exhibit A, which is the transcript of the police log, and I notice that at
1:52 p.m., there was a 550-2-531, with the notation, "Suspect on shooting of
police officer is apprehended en route to the station." Was <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, that would have generally been&mdash;that would have <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would have been you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That would have been me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is marked "Westbrook-Batchelor." Is that because of the
No. 2 on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Possibly Batchelor's call is 2, and Westbrook's is 550, so apparently they
showed Westbrook was talking to Chief Batchelor, which at this <span class="locked">point&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Someone else put this handwriting in. That is, "Westbrook-Batchelor,"
but is that the time that you called in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; I don't remember the exact words, but I did get on the
radio as soon as we got to the car and it got moving, notifying that we were
en route to the station with the suspect. That would have been possibly right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It goes on to say, "From the Texas Theatre."</p>

<p>And, "caught him on the lower floor of the Texas Theatre after a fight."</p>

<p>Did you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This would have been the dispatcher to me asking the question did
we have him in the Texas Theatre. Was that where we arrested him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is 531-550-2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. In other words, it is dispatcher to 550 car 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. And he was finding out for sure if we had arrested him at the
theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then it goes to 550.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Car 2 would have been my answer to the dispatcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It says, "Caught him on the lower floor of the Texas Theatre
after a fight." And then 531-2-3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That would have been the dispatcher talking <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Someone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Chief Batchelor and Chief Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Two and three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Then 531 again would have been the dispatcher advising 305, which
is a homicide unit that the apprehension had been made.</p>

<p>And then the 550 car 2, to 531 would have been me telling him that we had 223,
who was Walker&mdash;that is Walker's call number, and 492, which was Carroll,
and Lyons' call number in the car with me.</p>

<p>And we later had to make arrangements for somebody to go back and pick
up 223 car and take it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That last call then was made at 1:53 p.m., in which you advised
who was in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. With us en route to the station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And the first one that you made after you got to the car was at
1:52 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, also turning to Sawyer Deposition Exhibit A, I notice that
there is another call on car No. 550-2. Was that you at that time, or not, at
1:40 p.m.?</p>

<p>Would that have been someone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That probably is R.&nbsp;D. Stringer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is not you, then, even though it has a number 550-2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; because Stringer quite probably would have been using the
same call number, because it is more his than it was mine, really, but I didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
have an assigned call number, so I was using a number I didn't think anybody
would be using, which is call 550-2, instead of the Westbrook to Batchelor as
it indicates here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now after, from the time you started in motion until the time you
called in, do you remember anyone saying anything at all in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The suspect was asked what his name was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He never did answer. He just sat there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he asked where he lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That was the second question that was asked the suspect, and he
didn't answer it, either.</p>

<p>About the time I got through with the radio transmission, I asked Paul Bentley,
"Why don't you see if he has any identification."</p>

<p>Paul was sitting sort of sideways in the seat, and with his right hand he
reached down and felt of the suspect's left hip pocket and said, "Yes, he has a
billfold," and took it out.</p>

<p>I never did have the billfold in my possession, but the name Lee Oswald was
called out by Bentley from the back seat, and said this identification, I believe,
was on the library card.</p>

<p>And he also made the statement that there was some more identification in
this other name which I don't remember, but it was the same name that later
came in the paper that he bought the gun under.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would the name Hidell mean anything? Alek Hidell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That would be similar. I couldn't say specifically that is what it
was, because this was a conversation and I never did see it written down, but that
sounds like the name that I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this the first time you learned of the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right; when did you learn of his address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There were two different addresses on the identification.</p>

<p>One of them was in Oak Cliff. The other one was in Irving. But as near as
I can recall of the conversation in the car, this was strictly conversation, because
I didn't read any of the stuff. It didn't have an address on Beckley,
that I recall hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Now from the time you got in the car to
the time you got to the station, I believe you said that at least the second question
asked was where do you live, and the man didn't answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The man didn't answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he ever asked again where he lived, up to the time you got
to the station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I don't believe so, because when Bentley got the identification
out, we had two different addresses. We had two different names, and the
comment was made, "I guess we are going to have to wait until we get to the
station to find out who he actually is."</p>

<p>After about the time Bentley reached in his pocket and got his billfold, the
suspect made the statement, "I don't know why you are treating me like this.
The only thing I have done is carry a pistol in a movie."</p>

<p>Then there was a remark made something to the effect, "Yes, sir; you
have done a lot more. You have killed a policeman."</p>

<p>And then the suspect made a remark similar to "Well, you fry for that," or
something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Something to what effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, now, he either made the statement, "You only fry for
that," or "You can fry for that," or a similar statement. Now the exact words
of it, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right; then what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Some more questions were asked as to where he had been prior
to going to the movie, which he did not answer. Some more questions were
asked as to what was his true name, and in neither case did he ever answer
them. He did make a comment, if I recall, about the handcuffs, about, "I don't
see why you handcuffed me." And here again he repeated the statement, "The
only crime I have committed was carrying a pistol in a movie."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
We got the suspect to the city hall as rapidly as possible without using the
siren and red light, but we took advantage of every open spot we had to make
a little speed, and we explained to him this&mdash;I did, before we got into the basement,
that there would probably be some reporters and photographers and
cameramen waiting in the basement when we got to the station, and that if
he so desired, we would hold him in a way that he could hide his face if he
wanted to, and also told him he did not have to speak to the press if he didn't
want to.</p>

<p>He didn't comment on this at this point, but as we pulled into the basement
from the Main Street side, we were wanting to get out and get organized
enough that we would set up our wedge again to get him in the station through
the basement, and so we pulled over to what would have been the southeast
side of the basement, got out of the car, and formed a wedge in the same
position that we left the theatre, and told the suspect again he could hide
his face if he wanted to.</p>

<p>And he said, "Why should I hide my face. I haven't done anything to be
ashamed of."</p>

<p>And with that we started walking him up the aisle of the basement and
walked him through the door into the basement of the city hall proper, put
him on the elevator, stayed on the elevator with him, put him back behind
the wall, and sort of formed a wall around him.</p>

<p>Some of the press pushed into the elevator with us.</p>

<p>Got him out on the third floor, walked him into the homicide and robbery
office, placed him in the first interrogation room inside the homicide and robbery
office, and left Officer Walker there with him.</p>

<p>At this point I stood in the door of the, or at the door of the room he was in.</p>

<p>Reporters wanted to see the pistol. I held it up to them but never relinquished
control of it. I asked Baker at this time, who was Detective T.&nbsp;L.
Baker, if he wanted the pistol, and he said, "No; hold on to it until later."</p>

<p>I explained to him that this was the suspect on Tippit and did he want us
to make up the arrest sheet, or would they make them up.</p>

<p>We were trying to get together to decide who was going to make the offense
report and get all the little technicalities out of the way when a detective named
Richard Stovall and another one, G.&nbsp;F. Rose, came up, and the four of us
were standing when Captain Fritz walked in.</p>

<p>He walked up to Rose and Stovall and made the statement to them, "Go get
a search warrant and go out to some address on Fifth Street," and I don't
recall the actual street number, in Irving, and "pick up a man named Lee
Oswald."</p>

<p>And I asked the captain why he wanted him, and he said, "Well, he was
employed down at the Book Depository and he had not been present for a
roll call of the employees."</p>

<p>And we said, "Captain, we will save you a trip," or words to that effect,
"Because there he sits."</p>

<p>And with that, we relinquished our prisoner to the homicide and robbery
bureau, to Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Walker, Bentley, Lyons, Carroll, and I knew that the prisoner had received
a laceration and bruises while effecting his arrest, and that an officer had been
scratched while effecting the arrest, and that Bentley had sprained an ankle,
and Lyons had sprained an ankle while effecting the arrest&mdash;they were fixing
to have to make a whole bushel basket of reports&mdash;we adjourned to the personnel
office, which was further down the hall from homicide and I sat down and
started to try to organize the first report on the arrest.</p>

<p>I originally had the heading on it, "Injuries sustained by suspect while
effecting his arrest in connection with the murder of Officer J.&nbsp;D. Tippit," and
a few minutes later Captain Westbrook came in the office and said that our
suspect had admitted being a Communist. This is strictly hearsay. I did not
hear it myself.</p>

<p>He himself also said a few minutes later he had previously been in the Marine
Corps, had a dishonorable discharge, had been to Russia, and had had some
trouble with the police in New Orleans for passing out pro-Castro literature.</p>

<p>This still is all hearsay because I didn't actually hear it firsthand myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
And at about this point Captain Westbrook suggested that I change the heading
of my report to include arrest of the suspect in the assassination of the President
and in the murder of Officer J.&nbsp;D. Tippit, which I did.</p>

<p>I originally wrote the report for Bob Carroll's signature and for my signature,
and left it with the captain to be typed while we moved over in another office
to get a cup of coffee and sort of calm down and recap the events.</p>

<p>By then McDonald was there, and we had added some information that he
could give us such as the information about "This is it." Which the suspect
allegedly said as he came into contact with him.</p>

<p>The exact location of the officers and who was there on the original arrest
and everything, and we were waiting around for the secretary to finish the
report.</p>

<p>When we got it back ready to sign, Carroll and I were sitting there, and it had
Captain Westbrook's name for signature, and added a paragraph about he and
the FBI agent being there, and not seeing that it made any difference, I went
ahead and signed the report.</p>

<p>Actually, they were there, but I didn't make any corrections.</p>

<p>And as far as the report, didn't allege what they did, but had added a
paragraph to our report to include the fact that he was there, and also that the
FBI agent was there.</p>

<p>Now as to why this was done, your guess is as good as mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They were there. They got there inside where we were about the
time he was being handcuffed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, let me go back a minute now.</p>

<p>You left the suspect in the custody of homicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what office was he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was still in the interrogation room and still in the homicide
and robbery bureau office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was in there with him when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. When I left the office, Captain Fritz, who was the commander of
the bureau was there, and I had assumed, being that he was the officer in
charge, the highest ranking man there, and it was his bureau and his office,
theoretically he was in possession of the prisoner.</p>

<p>However, now as to specifically who went in and took him out of the interrogation
room and took him to the captain's office, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Captain Fritz in the interrogation office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Captain Fritz was in the hall. There was a little small hallway to
the door here, and there is a hallway just big enough to pass through. The
suspect was in the interrogation room and Captain Fritz immediately in front
of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was anyone else in the interrogation room when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; Walker was, and when we turned him over to homicide, Walker
came out and Fritz and his people had control of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So when you and Walker left, the nearest office to him was
Fritz'?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As far as I know; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At any time up to the time you left, did you ever get any address
on the suspect as to where he lived other than the statement of Captain Fritz
that he had this address on Fifth Street somewhere in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Paul Bentley called off two addresses. One, as I recall, in Irving,
and another one in Oak Cliff, when he was reading from information inside the
suspect's billfold. But neither of these addresses was an address on 10th or
on Beckley.</p>

<p>As to exactly what they were, I don't recall, as I didn't see the identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would one of them have been an address on Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It very possibly could be. In fact I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To the best of your knowledge, did anyone in the car in which you
were riding down to the police station ever mention any Beckley Street address
for the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To the best of your knowledge, when the suspect was brought into
the police station, up to the time you left him with Captain Fritz there, had
anyone mentioned a Beckley Street address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What else did the suspect say, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Other than the statement he made about brutality in the theatre,
and other than the statements he made in the car about "Why are you treating me
this way? The only thing I have done is carry a gun," and "Why are you handcuffing
me, the only thing I have done is carry a gun," and when the comment
was made about something of killing an officer, and he said something to the
extent that you can only fry for that, and the man showed absolutely no
emotion.</p>

<p>He gave the appearance of being arrogant, and yet he didn't make boastful
statements. He was silent almost the entire time he was in the car except
for the flareup of the brutality in the theatre, and the two statements or the
three statements that he made in the car. He was silent almost the entire time
until we got to the basement when he made the statement that he didn't know
why he should hide his face, he didn't have anything to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When the comment was made about frying, did any police officer
in the car say in substance, "Maybe you will find out," or something like that?</p>

<p>Do you remember anything like that being said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There was probably a sarcastic remark to that made, but as to the
exact words of it, "You will find out," or "You will get a chance to find out,"
but I am sure there was an answer to his question, and I don't recall who
said it.</p>

<p>But as near as I can remember, it came from the back seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any reply by the suspect along the lines of "Well, I
understand it only takes a minute," or something like that?</p>

<p>Did you hear him say anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I don't recall that statement. It could have been made, because
there were about half a dozen conversations actually going on in the car.</p>

<p>At one point after I opened the pistol, and I did open it in the car, and found
that one of the slugs or one of the shells did have an indention to the primer
that could have been caused by the hammer, we made a comment that he tried
or he did pull the trigger, and this was in line with what Hutson had asked
me, in the theatre, had I heard the gun click.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that happened in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I can recall of specific detail.</p>

<p>There was quite a bit of excitement.</p>

<p>Everybody had been in the little scuffle and were huffing and puffing, and especially
me, as fat as I am, but there weren't any, I don't recall any more direct
statements. There was nothing ever said in the car that I can recall that
would have put it at this time. We didn't have enough to be sure that maybe
the two were tied together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about the demeanor of the witness at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Other than as I said, he gave the appearance of arrogance, but
yet he did not talk boastfully. In fact, he talked very little. This was one
of the things that stuck out most about him in my mind, was how quiet he did
keep.</p>

<p>His commenting or relating the statement that the only crime he had committed
was carrying a gun in the theatre, and the refusal to answer questions as
to what his name was and where he lived, this is not unusual immediately
after an arrest, because when a man is arrested, he is keyed up too, and probably
thinks that the best thing that they can do is keep their mouth shut, and
he had previously in the theatre said he wanted his attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He had said this in the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; when we arrested him, he wanted his lawyer. He knew
his rights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever say he requested an attorney on the way down to the
police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I do not recall.</p>

<p>I was going to say that by making the statement earlier, it is possible, it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
possibility that he decided the best thing to do was keep his mouth shut; that
is a supposition on my part, and I couldn't prove it as to the reason he didn't
say any more on the way to the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did the police get ahold of his address on Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I don't know. This apparently came from homicide later, and once
we turned him over to homicide, with the exception of seeing him walking down
the hall again in front of several TV people later in the day, I had nothing else
to do with the man. I never saw him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant Hill, from the time he was handcuffed until the time
you turned him over to Captain Fritz, except for the moments that he was in
the room with Officer Walker in the interrogation room, were you with the
suspect at all times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; and I was also with him when I was standing in the doorway
of the room when he was there, with Walker. The door was never closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The door was never closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. While you were standing in the doorway with Walker, did the
man, suspect, say anything at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I recall, sir. At this time when I was in the doorway, I
was talking to Baker and had my attention more on him and what he was
saying, because at that point we were trying to decide if he wanted the gun,
if we were going to make the offense, or homicide, or the officers that stayed out at
the scene to wait for the crime lab. We were talking trying to get the paperwork
straight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far was the suspect from you at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Sitting across the table, about as wide as this, and maybe 2 more
feet to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. About 6 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How close was the other officer to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The other officer was at the end of the table here. He was probably
4 feet from me and 4 feet from the suspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear the other officer say anything to the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear the suspect say anything at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I didn't hear the suspect say anything at all. Other than the
statement he made in the basement, I didn't hear him utter another word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If the suspect had told anyone his address from the time he was
apprehended until the time he was turned over to Captain Fritz, would you have
been in a position to hear that statement made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. With my attention diverted talking to Baker, it is possible that he
could have given his address to Walker without me hearing it, but I can't say for
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Apart from what he may have said to Walker, if there was anything
else that he could have said except for during that period, would you have
heard it if he said anything about living on North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I am sure until the time that the suspect was turned over to Fritz,
other than maybe a couple of words exchanged between Walker and the suspect
while I was standing in the door talking to Baker, I am sure I would have heard
it, and I never did hear the address North Beckley mentioned until much later
in the day, and this was strictly hearsay, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, did you hear any Beckley Street address mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I didn't hear anything on Beckley mentioned until probably 7
or 8 o'clock that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to Walker after he left the interrogation room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Talked to Walker after he left the interrogation room. He came
into the personnel office with us, and we sat down and made sure that&mdash;we just
talked over our story and made sure that we had all the details as to who was
where in the arrest, what door the man came in into the theatre, where they were
when the original contact was made, how Bentley hurt his foot, how Lyons hurt
his foot, and all this, and decided, well, rather than have to get everybody
back together and round them up and all six or seven people sign the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
report, it was decided that Carroll and I would be the only two that signed it,
and that Bentley would go on to the hospital and get his foot fixed, and Lyons
would go to the hospital and get his foot fixed, and after McDonald finally
got down there to the station and we sent him over to the city hall to get the
scratch on his face treated, and then the rest of the time, with the exception of
going across the hall for a cup of coffee, probably I didn't get out of the office
to almost 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Walker ever mention to you any conversation he had with
Oswald in the interrogation room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you and he discuss all the conversations that were had with
the prisoner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. With the exception of getting some information from McDonald
as to what Oswald actually said at the time of his contact with him in the
theatre, the statement to the effect, "This is it," I figured that I had been in on
the conversation when he was discussing the brutality and the statements he
made in the car, and the statement he made in the basement when we were telling
him he could duck his head if he wanted to, enough that I had all the information
that I needed for the report, so I never did discuss any of the conversation
that could possibly have taken place between Walker and the suspect in the
interrogation room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Over what period of time span would that have been that he was
in the interrogation room and you were standing in the doorway there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Probably 3 or 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when you were going down to the station in the car, I
believe the question was asked of the suspect to give his name and his address
and he refused, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He didn't answer either question. He didn't say, "I am not going
to tell you anything." He just didn't answer, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But at least Officer Walker never told you that he finally answered
that question, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you had one report that you entitled "The arrest of Lee
Harvey Oswald," which pertained to the Texas Theatre. Did you have any
other report that you made at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I had to make one later about a telephone call that I made from
San Antonio to Dallas when we got the flash down there on Sunday morning
that Oswald had been shot. I was attending a meeting down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, apart from that, anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Also, I made a statement to the FBI concerning the fact that I had
known Jack Ruby prior to this thing. But as far an another report, other than
the original report that afternoon on the arrest of the suspect, I don't recall
writing any other report after that one report that was signed by Carroll and
I and Captain Westbrook is the only one I wrote on the actual arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I see one 2-page report that is signed by you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Can I look at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You bet you can.</p>

<p>[Handing to witness.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This was later when they wanted a report from each individual
officer. Yes, sir; I did write this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are referring to a report dated what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This would have been dated November 22, sir, and it is signed by
Captain Westbrook and Bob Carroll and myself. I do not have it with me, but
in case it is not in there, I have a carbon copy of it with all three signatures on
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do with either the assassination investigation
or the Tippit investigation on Saturday, November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; I was off that day.</p>

<p>And then on Sunday the 24th, I had flown out of Dallas that morning on a
Braniff flight to San Antonio with a sergeant from Dallas and captain from
Garland and captain from Denison to attend a state board meeting of the Texas
Municipal Police Association in San Antonio at the International Building, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
we took a coffee break somewhere around 11:30 or 12, I don't know the exact
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was the last time you saw Jack Ruby prior to the shooting
of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It was probably 6 to 8 weeks, and that was a contact that I was
walking by a garage one night about the time he came down to get his car,
and we talked for a minute and that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what you said or what he said at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It just was a greeting. We hadn't seen each other in quite a while.
In the interim, I had been on&mdash;normally when I was on a rotating schedule of
working evenings and deep nights, the Carousel Club was located in the district
that I worked quite often, and I would stop in there once in a while, and I had
been on a special assignment for about 2 months working straight days, in town
and out of town, and I hadn't been by or hadn't seen him, and this particular
night we ran into each other, and he wanted to know what I was doing, and I
told him I was working in personnel.</p>

<p>And he said, I haven't been much around much lately, and I said, "I am
staying home."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was the last time you saw him prior to that meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Probably the last time, I was in his place on duty, maybe 3 or 4
weeks before this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if you would describe the situation in the police department
on the third floor with regard to reporters or what have you during the
period of time that you brought Oswald in and during the rest of the time you
might have been there on the afternoon of November 22?</p>

<p>What did you find when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There wasn't anybody except the ones that were down in the basement
waiting for us to bring him in, and they were standing in the doorway,
that if you turned to the right, you go in the jail office.</p>

<p>If you go straight, you go into the basement of the building.</p>

<p>Some of them rode up on the elevator with us. When we started off the
elevator, they got ahead of us and shot us walking down the hall and took
pictures of us going to homicide.</p>

<p>We carried him into the interrogation room and they followed us into the
homicide office.</p>

<p>At this time probably there were six or seven people, Jim Underwood from
KRLD was one of them, and I don't recall any more specifically by name.</p>

<p>But as time went by in the afternoon, more and more people came in until I
would say about 6:45 or 7 o'clock that night, the night of the 22d, when I left,
there were some 70- or 80-odd reporters and floodlights and two or three live
cameras and several more cameras on tripods, and out-of-town reporters, and
local reporters, and everything else, that officers were on duty and in uniform to
keep the halls open as much as possible.</p>

<p>And if you wanted to go from the elevator entrance on back toward homicide
or to any of the other detective offices, you had to drag your way through TV
cables and bodies of people, seesawing your course to get through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you have stated when we first started this deposition that
you had some background in either newspaper or radio or television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I worked at the Herald both as a police reporter, as a newswriter, and a
radio-TV editor, and left there and went with WBAP as a member of their Dallas
Bureau, covering the, working out of an office in the police station here in Dallas,
and covering police news and all other types of news also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any request ever made to the press people to clear the
hall or clear the floor at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not to my personal knowledge; no, sir. It could have been made
when I wasn't there, or it could have been made before I got there, or after I
left or while I was in an office or something, but I don't know that a direct order
was ever given to get everybody out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you tell us what general discussion there was among the
officers, the line officers, without quoting any names that might embarrass anyone,
about all of these people and paraphernalia there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As to the situation, we commented that it was a bad thing that we
didn't have a space big enough to put everybody and make press releases to
them like they did in some of the eastern cities.</p>

<p>I think somebody brought up the fact that in New York you wouldn't do what
was done here because everybody had to go to one place and when they got
ready to tell you something, they would come in and make a formal announcement,
and if they wanted to throw it open for questions they did, and if they
didn't they would walk out.</p>

<p>There was commenting on the smallness of the space that we had to work in
and the inconvenience there, and the building, had it been Brooklyn, it wouldn't
have created as much congestion and all.</p>

<p>But there was a feeling of congeniality between the police and the press, and
I observed some of the officers that did have to go ask somebody to move or get
out of the way, or not block a door, or so, or not block this, and the press was
very nice about cooperating and doing at that time what they were asked to do.</p>

<p>What happened Saturday and Sunday, I don't know. But it was rather
crowded, I will make that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant Hill, I have handed you these six bullets that you previously
identified with your signature on it here, and asked you to examine and
try to find which one, if any, had a scratch that you talked about, and you picked
out what might properly be the one.</p>

<p>What is the fact as to whether or not this depression was a deep one or was
one that you found difficult to see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It was one that I found difficult to see at the time.</p>

<p>However, the bullets had not been handled as much at that time, and they
were less shiny, and evidence would have been a little better on a dull shell
where a new marking had been made on it rather than one that had been
handled a few times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The two that you picked out are marked, I believe, "Q-80" and
the other one is "Q-177," is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think you said as between the two of them, you <span class="locked">saw&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Q-80 would be the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Sergeant Hill, we met one time earlier here, I think, a couple
of days ago, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I believe it was Friday afternoon, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Friday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Originally we had your deposition set for Friday afternoon, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You came and I had an airplane flight, an 8 o'clock flight, that
was canceled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I left at 5:30&mdash;and now it is past 7 o'clock&mdash;and I told you I
didn't think we had a chance to get your deposition.</p>

<p>At that time I believe I asked you just to state what general areas of work
you had worked in so we could try and see whether or not we had time to
take your deposition in half an hour, and I believe you described your work
at the Texas School Book Depository in general terms, and in general terms
your being at the Texas Theatre, but did we go into any details at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The only specifics we discussed were this.</p>

<p>You were asking Officer Hicks if either one recalled seeing a sack, supposedly
one that had been made by the suspect, in which he could have possibly carried
the weapon into the Depository, and I at that time told you about the small
sack that appeared to be a lunchsack, and that that was the only sack that I
saw, and that I left the Book Depository prior to the finding of the gun.</p>

<p>Or the section, if it was found up there on the sixth floor, if it was there, I
didn't see it.</p>

<p>Then you asked me some statement, if I had heard it in the car, but I
don't recall what statement it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
But I told you at that time there was remarks made, but I didn't recall
hearing that. I don't remember what it was.</p>

<p>Perhaps your memory on that is better than mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything else in specific that we discussed at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Otherwise, that is our only conversation that we had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; it was just very general and very limited due to the stress
of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, did you search the suspect that you brought in from
the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As to any other possible weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes; or ammunition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I did not search him, and being that he was handcuffed, and
being that they were moving him out hurriedly, I don't recall anyone else
searching him after he was placed under arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you can think of, whether I have asked it
or not, that is in any way relevant to this area of inquiry pertaining to the
investigation of the assassination, or the investigation of the Tippit murder?</p>

<p>Anything else you can think of that you would like to comment on at this
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not that I can recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant Hill, we want to thank you very much for your splendid
cooperation, and for the cooperation of the entire police department here, and
you particularly.</p>

<p>You had to make two trips, because of the fact that the one airplane of mine
was canceled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They were both on duty, so I don't mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have an opportunity, if you like, to read the typewritten
transcript of this deposition and sign it, or else you can waive the signing and
have it go directly to Washington without your reading.</p>

<p>Do you have any preference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Sir, if it would be all right, I would like to run by and sign it?</p>

<p>If you will just let me know when, I will be here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They will contact you and again we want to thank you very
much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It is my pleasure. Anytime I can help, let me know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What district do you patrol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I had two districts to patrol. District 105 and district 106.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. In the western end of the downtown section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were a downtown patrolman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear of the assassination of the President over the radio?
The fact that the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. We heard the call come out on the radio. There was a signal 19,
which would be a shooting of the President, at Elm and Houston Streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Were you told to go some place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. We reported the scene; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. To Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When&mdash;what did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. We helped cover off the building and control the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. From there to Oak Cliff, to the scene of the Tippit shooting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to go out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I was standing close to the squad car using the squad car as part of
the block to keep the crowd back and had run out of rope, and heard a citizen,
I presume, get on the radio, and&mdash;because he didn't know radio procedure, called
and said a police officer was shot out there. At first give the wrong address, and
come back and changed it to another address, and I believe he left us in the 400
block of East Ninth, the last time, and we went out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you find when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. We <span class="locked">found&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Found the squad car parked toward the curb, and a pool of blood
at the left-front wheel of the car. The ambulance had already picked him up
and the officer had left the scene when we arrived. We had&mdash;I don't know how
many people there were. Looked like 150 to 200 people around there, and Mrs.
Markham, I talked to her first and we got a description of the man that shot
Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what the description was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what the description was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. White male, about 25, about 5 feet 8, brown hair, medium, and I
believe she said had on a white jacket at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. We gave the description to several of the officers at the scene. You
couldn't get on the radio at the time, there was so much traffic on the radio,
and the last&mdash;the direction he was seen leaving, and then I talked to several
more witnesses around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever put that description on the radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I believe we did. But I couldn't swear to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I talked to a Spanish man, but I don't remember his name.
Dominique, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Domingo Benavides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I believe that is correct; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. He told me, give me the same, or similar description of the man,
and told me he was running out across this lawn. He was unloading his
pistol as he ran, and he picked the shells up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Domingo told you who was running across the lawn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. A man, white man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. He was unloading his pistol as he run.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. He said he picked the two hulls up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he hand you the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you put any markings on the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I couldn't swear to it; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I turned the hulls into the crime lab, which was at the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the name of the man with the crime lab or from the
crime lab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I couldn't swear to it. I believe Pete Barnes, but I wouldn't swear
to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to any people there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Talked to Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to the two Davis girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I talked to one of them, but I can't recall talking to two Davis
girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what a Detective Dhority there at the scene did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I remember Detective Leavelle at the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Leavelle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the Davis girls give you anything? Either one of the Davis
girls hand you anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. She give me the same general description of the suspect as Mrs.
Markham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. White male, and in his early 20's, around 5'7" or 8", about 145
pounds, and I believe she said had on a white jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a&mdash;off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have here a broadcast by Walker. Do you know Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Walker there at the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir; he came by the scene after I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I don't know. I want to say C.&nbsp;T., but I am not positive on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 1:22 p.m., on the transcript of the radio log, I note it says,
"Have a description of suspect on Jefferson. Last seen about the 300 block of
East Jefferson. White male, 30's; 5'8", black hair, slender built, wearing white
shirt, black slacks."</p>

<p>Do you know whether you gave Walker that description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I remember giving Walker a description. My partner got in the car
with Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you give Walker a description similar to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, the only difference I see between the description you said
you gave the other officer and this was that you said he was in his 20's or 25,
and this says about 30. Otherwise it is about the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who told you he had on a white jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Mrs. Markham told me first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir; Mrs. Markham was awfully excited, and she was&mdash;looked
like about to faint, and I tried to calm her down as much as I could at first and
get as much as I could out of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many cartridges, or empty cartridges or shells were given to
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. There were two in an empty Winston cigarette package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you save the Winston cigarette package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I turned it in with the two cartridges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To the crime lab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I have here a package which has been marked "Q"&mdash;FBI
lab. Q-74 to Q-77. Would you look those over and see if there is any identification
on there by you to indicate that those were the hulls given to you by
Benavides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I want to say these two are mine, but I couldn't swear to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make a mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I can't swear to it; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But there is a mark on two of these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. There is a mark. I believe I put on them, but I couldn't swear to
it, I couldn't make them out any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the ones you said you made a mark on are&mdash;you think it is
these two? Q-77 and Q-75?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir; those two there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Both marked Western Special? They both are marked Western
Special. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. At the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I stayed there until Leavelle and his partner from the crime lab got
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir; I got out and helped try to find the suspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you at the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him apprehended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. At the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that is all, Mr. Poe.</p>

<p>This will be written up and submitted to you for your signature, and you can
sign it if you wish, or waive your signature.</p>

<p>Which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Well, sir; I don't have anything to hide. I will tell the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to give your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. I will sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay. We'll do that. We can notify you and you can come up
here and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. All right.</p>

Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before the
Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. John Gibson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I am manager of a retail store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of retail store is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. It's Elko Camera store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the address of the Elko Camera Store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. 239 West Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Near the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I'm four doors from the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born, Mr. Gibson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I was born in Brashear, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Woodrow Wilson High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, what have you done since you got out of school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, after I got out of school I went in service in the Navy
and stayed in there 2 years and came back and went to work for Snap-Shots,
Inc., and then went to work for Hermetic Seal in Garland, and then went to
work for Elko.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, did you go to a picture show that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. It was at 1 o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you go to the picture show very often&mdash;that particular theatre&mdash;the
Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Like I said&mdash;that's on Friday and that is depending on business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day do you usually go on Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. About 1 o'clock&mdash;the same time I always go to lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you sit on this Friday, November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I sat in the first chair from the rear on the far right-hand side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that where you always sit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. That's where I always sit&mdash;that's my chair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a picture here of the theatre, which I will have marked
as Exhibit A, and will you look at that picture? Does that look like the interior
of the Texas Theatre to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes, sir; it's got more light on it than I've seen most of the time&mdash;that
looks like it.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as Gibson Exhibit No. A, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is the seat in which you usually sit shown in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is that seat with reference to the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Further to the left&mdash;from the main seating in the very back&mdash;it
would be just past him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There's a man sitting in the back in the first seat in the center aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Right, and I would be&mdash;to his right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the same row?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. In the same row.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To his right facing the screen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And on the other aisle, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the lights come on in that theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you paid any attention to other people who had come in the
theatre before the lights came on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what happened after the lights came on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, when the lights came on, of course, as I said before, I
know most of the people that work there in the show and I got up and started
to the front to ask where the head usher or the girl was that works these lights&mdash;if
something was wrong&mdash;I thought maybe they had a fire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you started to the front, you mean you started into the
lobby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I started to the lobby, and just before I got to the door there
were two or three&mdash;anyway the first police officer that got to me was carrying
a shotgun, I remember that, and he says, "Is there anybody in the balcony?"</p>

<p>I said, "I don't know." He went on up into the balcony and I stood around
out in the lobby for&mdash;I don't know&mdash;a minute or something, I guess, and they
kept coming in and I stepped back inside the theatre just standing just behind
where I had been sitting and I would say there were at least six or possibly
more policemen downstairs. The rest of them were going upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, I was standing there watching all this going on and then
the policeman started down the aisle&mdash;I would say there was another&mdash;I don't
know, maybe six or eight&mdash;started down the aisles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you say "down the aisles," you mean all of the aisles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Toward the screen&mdash;I don't know if they were going down all of
them or not. I don't believe there was any&mdash;there was one policeman standing,
it seems to me like, right on the other side of me, in the far aisle&mdash;just behind
me&mdash;I don't think there was anybody going down the far aisle next to the wall
on my side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What aisles did you see policemen going down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I saw them going down what I would call the two big center<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
aisles, and then the next thing was&mdash;Oswald was standing in the aisle with a
gun in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the next thing you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anybody with him&mdash;near him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I couldn't swear to that&mdash;I don't know&mdash;you mean other policemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's what I mean&mdash;was he in the aisles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, he was in the aisle when I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, he had this pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was anybody near him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Just the officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the officer doing&mdash;did you say officers or police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Plural, officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes; there were more than one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were they doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, they were going toward him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they have ahold of him at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anyone have ahold of him at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any officer grab hold of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which one&mdash;can you describe where he was and what he did&mdash;just
tell us in your own words what you saw him do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, just like&mdash;I guess you have heard this a lot of times&mdash;the
gun misfired&mdash;it clicked and about the same time there was one police officer
that positively had him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean&mdash;"had him"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, I mean he grabbed ahold of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he grab ahold of him before you heard the click or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Gee, that's a question that's kind of hard to answer because I
would say possibly seconds before or a second&mdash;maybe at the precise time the
gun clicked. It happened pretty fast and like I say, I just went in to eat a hot-dog
for lunch and I wasn't expecting any of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any officer strike Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No, sir; not directly; I saw them take him to the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald strike any officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. [Shaking head for negative answer.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Not that I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anybody say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, I heard the officers, but I don't remember what they said&mdash;I
couldn't tell you if my life depended on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear Oswald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mentioned the fact that they took him to the floor, you mean
they actually went down in the floor of the theatre or close to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, from where I was standing and looking across&mdash;they took
him to the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any seats in the way when they fell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No; I was standing up&mdash;yes; there was seats in the way, but I
was looking at an angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald fall on the seats or on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. They fell on the floor as best I could tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I didn't see anything happen&mdash;I walked back to the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald leave the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes; I saw the officers bring him out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Describe what you saw at that time&mdash;I want to know how they
had ahold of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, right after they took him to the floor, as I said, he had a
gun in his hand and I turned around and walked back into the lobby, the front
part of the theatre, and just right after I walked out into the lobby, one of the
policemen yelled, "Lock the doors," and so I walked up and started locking the
doors and the head usher, Butch, came running out and he started at one end
and I started at the other end. There was six or eight doors in the front, and
we locked them up and then they brought Oswald through the door&mdash;there was
two police officers that had ahold of him, and his arms were bent around behind
him&mdash;like so [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did the officer have his arm around his neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I don't know&mdash;I don't think so&mdash;he did have a black eye and his
shirt was about halfway torn off of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear Oswald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. He said, "I protest police brutality."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At any time did you see an officer, while the officers were struggling,
with Oswald, did you see an officer strike Oswald with the butt of a shotgun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a shotgun in the hands of any of the officers who were
struggling with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any officer in possession of a shotgun in the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Oh&mdash;yes, yes; I saw quite a few in possession of a shotgun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any officers with shotguns near Oswald when he was
struggling with these other officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Gee, I don't know&mdash;that, I couldn't say&mdash;because like I say, when
they took him down to the floor, all I could&mdash;or I should say down&mdash;I turned
around and went back to the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the police talk to the other patrons of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, as I said, the only thing that they said to me&mdash;the first
policeman that I saw in the theatre was right after the lights came on and
he asked me if there was anyone upstairs, but I can't definitely say I saw them
talking to anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did any officers talk to you afterwards and get your name
and address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see them take the name and address of anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No, sir; right after they put Lee Oswald in the police car and
drove off, I walked outside and went back over to the store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I understood that one group of the police headed for Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, I don't believe they really headed for him&mdash;I believe they
just started down through the theatre. From what the boy told me&mdash;Johnny
Pardis told me, he followed him into the theatre and he went upstairs, and I
believe this is why all the policemen went upstairs. I don't think they really
headed for him. I mean, they just evidently, as I said, all of them went upstairs,
with the exception of a small majority, say 6 or 8, maybe 12 downstairs
and inside the theatre there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they pass you on their way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. You mean up the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; the smaller party that was downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No; I was standing on this far side right next to the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And they were in an aisle over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, actually, they were two or three aisles over&mdash;there's two
big main aisles, and then there's another small aisle that runs down the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any other patron of the theatre along the way that they
went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. I don't know this, as I said, for a fact&mdash;this is what a lady
at the show told me. She sent Butch, the head usher up on the stage to guard
the exit back there and where he come from I don't know, because as I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
when they took him to the floor, then I turned around and walked out into the
lobby and one officer hollered, "Lock the doors," and Butch came through there
to the doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you didn't see other officers go up to any other patrons of the
theatre over there on their way to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As they went along&mdash;they finally walked up and outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. No; they were just looking in general it appeared to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anyone who was sitting closer to them than Oswald
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Gosh&mdash;I don't know&mdash;it's hard to remember, when you try.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know why they went up to him and not someone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, as I said&mdash;I don't think they went up to him. As I said,
the first time I saw him in the theatre definitely was when he was standing in
the aisle with a gun in his hand. Now, somebody told me that Oswald jumped
up and whirled around and said, "This is it," but this is something I don't know,
so this is hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But would you think he stood up first before any police officer got
to him? Or that near him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. He had to, because they took him from a standing position to the
floor and he was standing up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see them before they came up to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Yes; I was watching them there, I was just standing in the
corner&mdash;as I said, just looking around the corner&mdash;there is a chance you can
see in the corner and I was looking around it and as I said, I don't know whether
he got up and whirled around or what he did, but when I saw him he was
facing the police with a gun in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The first you saw him he was standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. He was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you didn't hear him say anything except on his way out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Except on his way out&mdash;is the only thing I heard him say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be written up and you can come down and sign it if you
want to, or you can waive your signature. What would you like to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Well, I said it, I might as well sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay. You will be called in to come down and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>. Thanks very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t74">TESTIMONY OF JAMES PUTNAM</h2>

<p>The testimony of James Putnam was taken at 11 a.m., on April 9, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. John Hart Ely, member of the staff of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you stand up and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. James Putnam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. 2015 Joan Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Police officer&mdash;sergeant of police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Ten years and four months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you give us something of your background before you started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
to work for the police department&mdash;where you went to school and what you
did before you became a policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Is this pertinent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Is this pertinent to the deposition? Well, if you want it, I will
give it to you. I went to school at Charleston, S.C. and I was in the Navy for
about 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And did you go directly from the Navy to the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No; from the Navy I went to work for Lone Star Gas Co. here in
Dallas. From there I went to work for Prudential Insurance Co. from which
I was recalled into the Navy again, and when I was released, I went back to
the insurance company, and from there I applied for employment with the Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Thank you, sergeant. Now, on November 22, 1963, were you on
duty with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did your duties on that day involve you in any way in the investigation
of the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What was the nature of your involvement with that investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Just to assist in covering of the Book Depository Building
and aiding in searching the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did your duties involve you in any way in the investigation of the
shooting of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you state the nature of your specialty with the police department?
What sort of work do you specialize in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. My assignment then and now is sergeant of police, supervising
patrolmen in the radio patrol division.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Putnam Exhibit No. 1," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Sergeant, I will show you first a map which is designated Putnam
Deposition Exhibit No. 1, and I will also show you two documents designated
Sawyer Exhibits A and B, which purport to be transcripts of radio logs from
the 22d of November. Now, although you would have no personal knowledge
of where Officer Tippit was assigned that day, assume for purposes of my
questioning that his original assignment on the 22d of November was within
the area marked 78 on Putnam Exhibit 1. Can you tell me within which district
the corner of Lancaster and Eighth Street is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. District 109.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And is it correct that here on the exhibit marked Sawyer Deposition
Exhibit A there is a call recorded at 12:54 p.m., from 78 to 531 reporting
he was at Lancaster and 8th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, assuming that Officer Tippit was originally assigned to the
district numbered 78, taking into account the report that at 12:54 he was
within the district marked 109, and also assuming that he later was shot within
the district marked 91, would you look at these radio logs and tell us if you
find on either one of them any calls which would account for the fact that
he had thus come in toward the center of town from the district he was originally
assigned to? Feel free to draw upon your general knowledge of the custom in
the Dallas Police Department for leaving, or remaining in, one's assigned district.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. One transmission here on channel 1, that would be the normal
channel that Tippit would be listening to, at 12:43 p.m. on Sawyer's Deposition
Exhibit B, is to the attention of all squads in the downtown area, code 3
to Elm and Houston, and with Officer Tippit being assigned to district 78
and allowed the discretion that is allowed in the Dallas Police Department&mdash;he
would start in the direction of the downtown area. A feasible route would
bring him to district 109 and that vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Is there any special reason why that would be a feasible route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. This Houston Street, if you will notice right in this corner&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>Houston
Street adjoins district 109. It is one of the routes you can use to
cross the river into the downtown area. This would be the normal procedure
as far as Officer Tippit was concerned, to come in toward the downtown
area, unless disregarded and a later transmission on channel 2, after getting
his location, advised him to remain at large in the Oak Cliff area. "At
large," would indicate that he would feel free to go nearer in the Oak Cliff
area, with the idea in mind that he would be looking for any suspect or
any suspicious circumstance that might be related to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Are districts 78, 109, and 91 all located within the Oak Cliff area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. They are located in the Oak Cliff area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right, thank you, Sergeant Putnam, I believe that's all.</p>

<h2 id="t76">TESTIMONY OF LT. RIO S. PIERCE</h2>

<p>The testimony of Lt. Rio S. Pierce was taken at 11:25 a.m., on April 9, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. John Hart Ely, member of the staff of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you stand and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Lieutenant, I am here as a representative of the President's Commission
which is looking into all the facts surrounding the assassination of
President Kennedy, and we have been informed that you might have information
which would help us in this inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Rio Sam Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. 3227 South Edgefield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you tell us what your occupation is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Officer&mdash;police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what rank do you hold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You are a lieutenant with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you tell us something about what you did before you started
to work for the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, I was raised on a farm out in West Texas and engaged
in farming practically all of my life up until I went in the Marine Corps. After
I got out of the Marine Corps in 1946, in April I believe it was, I came to
the Dallas Police Department in August 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you tell us, please, what your job is? What do you specialize
in with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I am assigned as a lieutenant in the patrol division out of the
central station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Were you in Dallas on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Part of the day. I went to Ennis, Tex., early that morning
and returned to Dallas about&mdash;oh, it was approximately 1 or 1:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you have anything to do with the investigation of the killing
of either President Kennedy or Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I will show you three exhibits, one is a map designated Putnam
Exhibit No. 1. The other two are designated Sawyer Deposition Exhibits A and
B, and are copies of the Dallas Police Department's radio logs for November 22,
1963.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
If you will for the moment assume that Officer Tippit was assigned to patrol
the district marked No. 78 on Putnam Exhibit No. 1. Can you explain why,
subsequent to the shooting of the President, Officer Tippit would be in the district
marked 109&mdash;specifically at the corner of Lancaster and Eighth&mdash;at 12:54 p.m.,
and then would later have proceeded into district 91, which is the area in which
he was shot and killed?</p>

<p>Will you look at these radio logs to see if you can find any calls which would
lead him to take this route? Use any other information at your disposal to
explain to us why he would have gone out of district 78 and over into Nos.
109 and 91?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, I see one transmission here that I think would have
alerted any officer knowing the fact that the President was in town, at 12:43&mdash;I
believe this occurred on channel 1&mdash;this was taken from channel 1 recordings
at 12:43. It says, "Attention all squads of downtown area, code 3 to Elm and
Houston with caution."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Explain what code 3 means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That's an emergency. In other words, that is, we have code 1,
which is normal driving; we have code 2, and a code 3. In other words, code 3
is your top&mdash;proceed with haste and caution. The transmission followed
that at 12:44, "Attention all squads, the suspect in the shooting at Elm and
Houston is reported to be an unknown white male," and gives the description
here&mdash;would also be an indication to the squads, and reading this&mdash;and I assume
that this is the way it came out&mdash;a man would have to draw his own judgment,
because it hasn't told you yet that the President has been shot, but I would
think that any normal police officer would assume that there had been something
pertaining to that, probably, and it would be normal procedure for him
working in the district he is working in to pull into a closer area to the downtown
area, and this district 109, which is, I believe you stated, that as being
at Eighth and Lancaster&mdash;it doesn't show here on your map, but you have no
viaduct&mdash;that's about the only place you can cross that river, unless you want
to wade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you mark on the exhibit with your red pencil where that
viaduct would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, you see, Cadiz Street over here in the downtown area&mdash;it
also crosses this river and comes on out&mdash;may or may not be nearly correct&mdash;it
isn't too far from wrong&mdash;I don't think so&mdash;there is two viaducts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. The red mark you have just drawn is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. The red mark is one viaduct that crosses that river and the area
where he was at that time, I will just have to use this&mdash;Lancaster Street comes
in something like that&mdash;it isn't marked on here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. But, he wouldn't be too far from that Cadiz Street viaduct.
Anyway, they come over that Cadiz Street viaduct, and also you have quite a
few apartment houses along there on Lancaster and Marsalis. In other words,
there is a large number of people that live over in there. That seemed to me
like he was probably using pretty good judgment in getting in that particular
area because he would have a chance there to assist from the downtown area
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. This transmission to which you referred, the one appearing at 12:43
p.m. on Sawyer Deposition Exhibit B, purports to be directed only to all squads
in the downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. But you think it would be normal even for those squads not located
in the downtown area to react?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I would have to call on my experience in the Dallas Police Department.
Under normal police procedure we request that the squads stay in
their district, but under any emergency situation we do not require that they
stay in their district.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. So, you would characterize this as a normal course of behavior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It looks like a normal procedure to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right. Do you think of anything else that you would want to
mention in connection with this, or do you think that just about covers it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, like I say, I was on my day off and I would just have to
assume what was happening, but I don't know anything in connection with
Tippit, but in this location, if that is what you are interested in, that would
not be unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, that's what we are interested in. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what rank do you hold in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. How long have you been with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Twenty-three and a half years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you give us a general idea of what you did before you went
with the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. How far back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Starting with your schooling, let's say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Most of my schooling was in Dallas. I was born in Madill
[spelling] M-a-d-i-l-l, Okla. I started school in Wilburton, Okla., and from
there to Shawnee, Okla., and from there to Ennis, Tex., and then to Dallas, and
then I went through Winnetka. I'll say I graduated from City Park Grammar
School and Forest Avenue High School. After I got out of school in the depression,
I went to work at the Baker Hotel as a bellhop. I left there and went
up to Oklahoma for approximately a year, came back and went to work at
Sears, Roebuck and worked there 2½ years, and then went to work for the public
works department in construction, as a chainman in a survey crew until, let's
see, that was in 1938. I worked their until the spring of 1940. I worked 2
months in the fire department, left, and went back to engineers. In October
1940, I went to work in the police department. December 1, 1942, I went in the
Navy and got out January 6, 1946, and I returned to the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And you have been there ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what was the nature of your assignment on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Acting lieutenant, Oak Cliff substation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Because you were acting lieutenant in the Oak Cliff substation,
would that mean that Officer Tippit would be under your supervision?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. When and how did you first hear that there had been an incident
involving the President of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. I had eaten lunch and I was on the way back to the substation&mdash;channel
1 was not working properly&mdash;some mike&mdash;or some radio transmitter
had left the mike open and I couldn't hear, and I switched over to channel
2 and heard what sounded like Chief Curry say, "It looks like the President
has been hit," so, not knowing what he had been hit with, I go in the substation
and hear on the radio where they are sending squads downtown to Elm and
Houston, and I called the dispatcher's office and wanted to know if they wanted
me downtown. They were very busy and never did answer me, so from that,
I assumed that there was a big incident involved and maybe the President had
been shot, so I leave 4020 West Illinois where the substation is located and
proceed to Elm and Houston, code 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And what does code 3 mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. It means emergency with red lights and siren on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. I arrived at Elm and Houston, which is the location of the
Texas School Book Depository. Before I arrived, the squad was dispatched
to pick up a man&mdash;an officer on Stemmons, who had a colored man, who had
information regarding the shooting. Since I was close, I stopped and picked
up a colored man, a lady and two children, and take them to Elm and Houston,
and notified Inspector Sawyer of what I had. He informed me to send them
to the sheriff's office where they had set up this interrogation room. I turned
them over to a patrolman there with the instructions to take them over to
the sheriff's office. I stayed with Inspector Sawyer until I was informed that
there was a shooting in Oak Cliff involving a police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall the name of this colored man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. No. I told Inspector Sawyer that I was assigned to Oak Cliff
and an officer was involved in the shooting, and I was taking off, so I proceeded&mdash;I
got in my car, and Captain Westbrook and Bill Alexander, an assistant district
attorney, also was in the car with me and we started out to&mdash;I think the call
came out at 400 East 10th or 400 East Jefferson. There was confusion there
where the situation was. It was corrected and we went to the scene of the
shooting.</p>

<p>Now, right there&mdash;here's where I'm not quite sure&mdash;I don't know whether I
was given the gun and all&mdash;but I believe I was given the gun and this was
Tippit's gun and shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you recall who gave them to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. No; some officer, but I don't know who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And how long did you have the gun and shells in your custody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Well, I had them at the hospital and we put them in a paper
envelope, a large paper envelope with some more of his possessions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did you make any identifying marks on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. No; they were his city issued&mdash;his own gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And do you recall whom you gave them to eventually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. No; I believe it was Barton&mdash;I'm not sure. I couldn't say
positively who I gave them to, to go put them in the property room. In fact,
I don't even know whether I gave them to anybody. I might have taken them
out to the Oak Cliff substation and put them in our property room&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, you were back at the stage where somebody had given you
the gun, and let's go on from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Yes&mdash;we were informed by a man whom I do not know, that
the suspect that shot Officer Tippit had run across a vacant lot toward Jefferson,
and thrown down his jacket, I think he said, white, I'm not sure. Not
finding anybody that had seen him come out of that area, we blocked off that
square block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Can you tell us specifically what block you blocked off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. I believe it was the 400 block of East Jefferson&mdash;the
400 or 500 block. It was this block bound by Jefferson, 10th, Patton, and
Denver&mdash;I believe that was the area. Then we started searching the buildings and
houses&mdash;there are some old two-story houses there used as businesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What was the nature of your search of these buildings? Did you
just look through the halls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Well, I didn't go in. I was standing on the outside and the
other officers were going in. I was covering off. Then, we heard over the radio
that some officer, who by the number, I took to be a three-wheeler motorcycle
officer had seen someone answering the description, go into the basement of
the library, which is on the corner of Marsalis and Jefferson, which was about
two blocks away. Quite a few of us left that area we were at and proceeded
to the library, covered it off, and they brought out the one that they thought
was the suspect, but he fit the general description, but he was not the one
we were looking for. He was an employee of the library that heard the
President had gotten shot and he had been to lunch and he was running over
there to tell them that the President got shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In other words, someone saw this employee run into the library,
and that's the reason you came in. He had just run into the library?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. That's the man that had run across Jefferson and run into the
basement of the library, so I went back to the scene of the shooting of Officer
Tippit and another call had come and some of my men yelled to me that they
had a suspect in the Texas Theatre, and everyone left there, but nobody was
left to help guard the scene except the crime lab man, so I remained at the
scene, and everybody else went to the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember who the crime lab man was who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. At the time I thought it was Captain Doughty [spelling]
D-o-u-g-h-t-y. They finished up taking the pictures and I left the scene and
went to Methodist Hospital where Officer Tippit had been taken, and I was
taken back to the room where he was taken, and in just a brief examination
of the body I saw where one bullet had entered his right chest about
the pocket and went through a package of cigarettes. Another one hit him
about the center of the chest and hit a button, and another one, I believe,
was in his right temple, I'm not sure which temple it was, but those three
wounds, I did see. I don't know whether he was shot any more or not. I
remained at the hospital for quite a time, and then I went back to the Oak
Cliff substation where I was assigned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And because you were assigned to the Oak Cliff substation, you at
no time during these 2 days or so went into the main police headquarters; is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. What, now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You didn't go to the main police headquarters because you were
assigned to the Oak Cliff substation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. No; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, I show you a map which is labeled Putnam Deposition Exhibit
No. 1. Could you tell us what sort of a map this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. It is what we call a district map of the various districts of the
city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. The various districts to which patrolmen are assigned, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. It is what it was set up for. Now, there isn't a squad for each
numbered district. Some squads have two or more numbers. I mean, the districts
cover that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And could you tell us to which district or districts on that map Officer
Tippit was assigned on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. He was assigned to district 78. Now, I don't know whether we
were short any squads that day or not, and if we were, he would be assigned to
cover another district also. His call number would still be 78.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would his call number be 78 even if he were outside the district?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I show you now one of the radio logs which is designated "Sawyer
Deposition Exhibit A." Am I correct in saying that at 12:54 p.m., according
to this log, Officer Tippit reported by radio that he was then at the corner of
Lancaster and Eighth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. That's right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, in which district on this map would the corner of Lancaster
and Eighth fall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. In district 109.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. That would be district 109. In which district on the map was
Officer Tippit shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. In district 91.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, we would like to have your opinion as to why Officer Tippit,
who was assigned to district 78, would have been in district 109 at 12:54 p.m.
and then later in district 91? In giving us your answer, please feel free to refer
to both of these radio logs, which are Sawyer Deposition Exhibits A and B,
and also draw upon your experience with the Dallas Police Department and
the common procedure for reacting to an emergency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. It says here on channel 1, this is Sawyer Deposition Exhibit
B, "Attention all squads in the downtown area, code 3, to Elm and Houston
with caution," and knowing that the President's parade was going to be
down in that area and also at 12:44 this: "attention all squads, the suspect in
the shooting, Elm and Houston, is reported to be an unknown white male,
approximately 30, slender build, height, 5 feet 6 inches, weight, 165 pounds,
reported to be armed with what is thought to be a .30 caliber rifle, no further
description or information at this time;" and then it recites at 12:45 signal
19 involving the President&mdash;that was at <span class="locked">12:45&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And signal 19 means what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. A shooting&mdash;anything of that magnitude in the shooting of the
President is one of the greatest magnitudes, and any officer would proceed as
near that location as possible to try to apprehend whoever had done it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, would somebody in an outlying district head for Elm and
Houston itself, or would he just come in closer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. He would move in that direction, and when they had ordered
all downtown squads to proceed to Elm and Houston, knowing that he was
going to have to answer calls in the downtown area while they are there, and
if you know that in all probability you may get called in, and&mdash;instead of the
district you are in, you are going to head down there so it won't take you near
as long, and also you can still be in the area if the suspect comes your way, you
will have a better chance of apprehending him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. So, you think Tippit might have been filling in for the people whom
he knew had been pulled in to Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. That's what I think&mdash;not only filling in, but also looking for
the suspect, because he heard about the shooting and the general description
of the suspect, and not knowing which way he went, but he could have gone any
way, then he is going to head downtown as soon as possible so if he sees someone
answering that description, he can apprehend him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You would say it would be normal procedure for an officer in district
78, which is located out in the outlying districts, to head downtown in any
emergency?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Could you perhaps give us an explanation of why he headed over
toward 109 and 91? That doesn't seem to be the most direct route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. According to this map&mdash;it doesn't show all the things on there&mdash;it
looks like you would have to zigzag quite a bit, but you wouldn't. You could
go down Corinth Street and go across the viaduct, but that would get him down
on Industrial, which would still be a lot of traffic to go through. He could go
down Clarendon to Marsalis and go North Ewing and then get over to Lancaster,
and a would give him a straight shoot to the Houston Street viaduct, which
would take him right to Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. So that you think a path of going from 78 to 109 to 91 would be a
more or less logical route for getting into the center of town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. On the 22d of November, did you, yourself, have an area which you
were patroling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. I was supervising all of the Oak Cliff area, and since I was acting
lieutenant, and I made the assignments for that day, I was at the station at
4020 West Illinois at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In which numbered area is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. That would be on district 97, and no one sent me, but when I
heard all of this&mdash;so many squads getting called to report there, then I went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You headed toward the downtown area yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Yes; I went to Elm and Houston myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Even though you didn't have a specific order to go in there either?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. That's right&mdash;that's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Officer McDonald, who testified before the Commission, told us
that he went to the corner of Elm and Houston, do you know which numbered
area on this map he was assigned to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. He was working district 95, which covers district 95 and 96.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record between Counsel Ely and the witness Owens.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. I don't know what district Officer J.&nbsp;L. Angel was working,
but it was my understanding that he also went to Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, he was working somewhere in the Oak Cliff area, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. Yes; he was working in the Oak Cliff area under the same
sergeant that Officer Tippit was working under, so he would be in the same
general area which covers these districts in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. That would be districts 82 and 85?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. No&mdash;81, 82, 85, 86, 87, or 76, 77, 78, or 79&mdash;that's that sergeant's
district.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right, thank you very much, sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. I don't know of anything else&mdash;as I say, I couldn't remember
where they handed me the gun. I knew it was at the scene because my wife
said she saw it on television and I had his gun, and when I asked her about it
she said it wasn't the suspect's gun she knew because she has been a policeman's
wife long enough to know I wouldn't be handling a gun like that if it was the
suspect's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right, Sergeant, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Owens</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. This looks like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Commission's Exhibit 162, a grey, zippered jacket. Have
you ever seen this before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; that looks like what he had on. A jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the jacket he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when the deposition is completed it will be written up and

without it. Do you have any choice on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I will sign it. It don't make any difference to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Ever what that means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That means you don't have to sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I will sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, actually, I went to&mdash;I was over in Oak Cliff, around
about, I guess, about 12 o'clock, I imagine is what time it was. I was there and
the show hadn't opened up, so, I was sitting in my car listening to the radio
up until the time that the show opened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went in the show when it opened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Paid your way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you take your seat? What part of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. About six rows down, I got in the middle aisle, about the middle
of the chairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Middle aisle, six rows from the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were how far from the middle aisle into the row of
seats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, about&mdash;seemed quite a little while since I thought about
this. I guess I was about four or five seats over from the aisle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the aisle. Now, did something happen there during that
showing of that picture that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, I know this much, Audie Murphy introduced the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then some police officers came in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; the lights came on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what do you remember happening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I seen the officers come down the right-hand aisle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the rear, or from the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. From the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Come in from the screen side, or the place you enter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Where you enter it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From your rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; came in on the right-hand aisle over against the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have anything in his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes; I believe he had a shotgun. Might have been a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, when I seen him, I was wondering what was the matter
and what about the lights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You got up and ran up to the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Went to the front to find out what was happened&mdash;was happened&mdash;happening.
As I was going up an officer passed me going down and I stopped to
find out.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; he passed me before I got a chance to ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Went to the front and turned around and started back up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Started back up the aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Towards you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you see him do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, he stopped and asked two boys sitting down in the front,
asked them to stand up <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he search them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; they shuffled them down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he search you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; they came on up to Oswald, where he was sitting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was he sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I&mdash;he was sitting, I guess, about 3 or 4 rows down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean from the rear of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. From the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how far over from the aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I guess that would be about three seats. They was sitting about
two or three seats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see him do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. He&mdash;started off, the officer said, "Will you stand up, please?"
And he stood up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How close were you to the officer and this man when you heard
the officer say, "Stand up"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I guess it was about&mdash;it was not over four seats down from the
back, rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you at the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; I was at the rear of the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were at the rear of the show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; well, there was a partition here. A partition here
[indicating], and there was about, oh, I guess about four rows down from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. In other words, the officer hadn't reached you yet,
when he asked Oswald to stand up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You stood up and went toward the rear of the theatre, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And going to ask the officer what was going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, you were about four rows away from where Oswald <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Apprehended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you hear the officer, what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; heard mainly what both of them said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did the officer say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. The officer said, "Will you stand up, please."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did the man say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, he just stood up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; I didn't hear him say anything at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, when he stood up, the officer stepped over to search him
down. The officer, Oswald, or the man, took a swing at him. When he did,
the officer grabbed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Took a swing at him with his fist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With his left or right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Right fist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Took a swing at him and what happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, the officer, I heard him say, "Here he is." And during
the proceeding of that, I guess about 5 or 10 seconds later, there was another&mdash;I
think it was two officers, or one, passed me and ran down there to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, the gun didn't come into view until after about four or
five officers were there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then did you see a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; but only&mdash;there was one gun. The pistol. It came
into view before any of the other officers got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is what I mean. What do you say happened about that?
Who pulled a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, anyhow, the officer was facing this way [indicating] and
Oswald was facing this way [indicating]. And then the gun was pointed out that
way [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wait a minute. I can't follow you when you say it was "this
way," and "this way," sir. You told me that this officer asked Oswald to stand
up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he stand up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then did he put his hand some place on Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; along <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I guess about his hips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did Oswald do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. He took a right-hand swing at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did the officer do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. The officer grabbed him then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you seen the pistol up to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; there was not one in view then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How soon after that did you see the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I guess it was about&mdash;I guess it was about 2 or 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who pulled the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I guess it was Oswald, because&mdash;for one reason, that he had on
a short sleeve shirt, and I seen a man's arm that was connected to the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did the officer do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, the officer was scuffling with him there, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, about the only thing I heard was the snap of the gun and
the officer saying, "Here he is."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard the snap of a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you familiar with guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, yes, sir; I am familiar with a few guns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Pistols? Have you ever shot a pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; I have shot my daddy's nine-shot .22 pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Sounded like a hammer of a pistol falling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened after that? You say several officers came
down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; they started wrestling and scuffling with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, there was about five officers, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any officers strike him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I seen one strike him with a shotgun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did he do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. He grabbed the muzzle of the gun and drawed it back and
swung and hit him in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. With the butt end of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Looked like a hard blow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; it&mdash;I guess it was. You could&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he struck Oswald where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. In the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What part of the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, somewheres along in the middle of the back, somewheres.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With the butt end of a shotgun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the officer strike Oswald with his fist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; I do not believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, how many officers were struggling with Oswald when you
saw the officer strike him with the butt end of the shotgun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I believe about four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see them handcuff Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Uhuh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see them handcuff the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; I didn't actually see the handcuffing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see them do after the struggle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, they were scuffling, and they were over to the middle,
about the far side of the aisle, and come up the other side of the aisle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then when they went out, did they come out through the doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; they came up through and one of the officers hollered
out, "Don't let nobody see him," and they came in right behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And went on out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you go out and follow them out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; I went out to the candy counter out there and the
officer said, if there's anybody in there that seen it&mdash;and asked&mdash;there was
about two or three, the candyman himself, and said&mdash;that one boy said that
he seen him, through the front&mdash;I mean out from behind the picture where
it came out&mdash;supposed to came out behind the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you give them your name there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. He asked my name and address and where I was staying at the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Later did you go down to the police station and make a statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, it was after&mdash;I guess after they got everybody's name.
I rode down with three officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That same day, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't go back to the picture show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; I did. There was a patrolman that carried me back
out and I was going to see the rest of it, but I never did get back in time to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't get to see the show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, I seen part of it, but I didn't get to see all of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see the man they arrested at the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; I didn't see him after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I have talked to you a little while before we took your
deposition, didn't I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I wasn't actually; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, I mean, you and I came <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And we sat and talked a few minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have told us everything that you told me <span class="locked">before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. This was taken here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before it was taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Yes; I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be written up, and you will have a chance to read it
and sign it. You can waive your signature and we'll forward it to the Commission
just as you have said it here in the way this young lady has written
it up. Does it make any difference to you now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; it don't make any difference. Anyway you do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are waiving your signature then, are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, I will sign it if you want me to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't have to if you don't want to. In other words, but you
may if you want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. I can sign it. If I sign it then you won't have any trouble with
it, will you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, then, I will sign it for you then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay, fine, that is all, Mr. Applin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. But, there is one thing puzzling me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. And I don't even know if it has any bearing on the case, but
there was one guy sitting in the back row right there where I was standing at,
and I said to him, I said, "Buddy, you'd better move. There is a gun." And
he says&mdash;just sat there. He was just back like this. Just like this. Just
watching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just watching the show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No; I don't think he could have seen the show. Just sitting
just like this, just looking at me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ever seen him since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; didn't. I tapped him on the shoulder and said, "Buddy,
you'd better move," <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you scared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. Well, when I seen the gun I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell the police officer about this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. No, sir; at the time, I didn't think about it, but I did tell&mdash;I
didn't even think about it when I went before the Secret Service man, but
I did tell one of the FBI men about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay. I guess that is all, Mr. Applin. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Applin</span>. All right.</p>

<h2 id="t91">TESTIMONY OF RAY HAWKINS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Ray Hawkins was taken at 9:50 a.m., on April 3, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you raise your hand and take the oath, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before this
Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Ray Hawkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And your address, where do you live now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. 7319 Cortland as of today. I am moving today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your business or occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I am with the Dallas Police Department. I am an accident
investigator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. It will be 11 years in June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me something about yourself&mdash;where you were born and your
education and what you have done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I was born in Dallas at Parkland Hospital. I attended the
Dallas schools except for 2 years when I lived in Denison and I served 3 years
and 4 months in the Coast Guard. I worked at the post office after getting out
of the service and then I worked for Dallas Power &amp; Light before coming to
the police department some 11 years ago. I have been in the traffic division 8<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
years last month, which my primary duty is accident investigation. Before
this time I served about 3 years in the radio patrol division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, you were on duty, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were your hours of duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I was working the 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you assigned some special duty because of the presence
of the President in the city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No, sir; on this day I was working accidents, which is my
regular duty. I was working with an officer by the name of Elmer Baggett
who had just transferred back into accident and I was giving him a refresher
course in the regular duties of accident investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you work in uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the regular patrolman's uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes&mdash;the regular patrolman uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it a marked police car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes&mdash;it is the blue and white marked police car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where were you around 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I'm not sure on the time&mdash;around it&mdash;if it was about the time
of the assassination&mdash;I was&mdash;we were on an accident in the 2500 block of North
Industrial, or in that vicinity, the first I had heard anything about this accident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and your partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you hear the President had been killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you later hear that Officer Tippit had been killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make a note of the time, or do you have any memory of
the approximate time that you heard that report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I would say in the vicinity of around 1 p.m.&mdash;I'm not sure
what time it was, because I didn't make any notes. As I said, we were on an
accident at the time&mdash;I cleared from the call about the time we heard this
information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you got that information over the police radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me, did you receive any instructions as to what to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No, sir; I did not. They called&mdash;I heard a citizen come in on
the radio and state that an officer had been shot and it looked like he was dead.
We had just finished the accident at this time and I was driving an officer,
Baggett, and I proceeded to Oak Cliff to the general vicinity of the call after
checking out with the dispatcher, stating that we were proceeding in that
direction.</p>

<p>We arrived in Oak Cliff and there were several squads in the general vicinity
of where the shooting had occurred&mdash;different stories had come out that the
person was&mdash;the suspect had been seen in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to 10th and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. We drove by 10th and Patton&mdash;we didn't stop at the location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. We circled the vicinity around Jefferson and Marsalis and
in that area, talking to several people on the street, asking if they had seen
anyone running up the alley or running down the street, and then they received
a call, or I believe Officer Walker put out a call that he had just seen a white
man running to the Oak Cliff Library, at which time we proceeded to this
location. Officer Hutson had gotten into the car with us when we arrived in
Oak Cliff, and there were three of us in the squad car&mdash;Officer Baggett, Officer
Hutson, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Hutson is also a patrolman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A uniformed patrolman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; he is a three-wheel officer. We went to the library
and this turned out to be an employee of the library who had heard of the
news and was apparently running in the library to tell the other employees there.</p>

<p>We then, after this checked out, we then continued circling in the area around
10th and Patton and Marsalis and Jefferson.</p>

<p>We then heard on the police radio that a suspicious person was at the Texas
Theatre, and at this time we proceeded to the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you park?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I parked my squad car in the alley at the rear of the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Officer&mdash;I believe Officer McDonald was at the back door at
the time and Officer Hutson and Captain Westbrook and Officer Walker and
myself went in the rear door, all went to the rear door, and at this time we saw
a white male there and began talking to him and he identified himself as being
the manager of a shoe store next door and that he was the person who had
noted the suspicious acting on the suspect, and he at that time was brought into
the rear of the theatre and on the stage and he pointed the person out sitting
about three or four rows from the back of the theatre on the right hand or
the south side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be near the right aisle as you face the screen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; near the right aisle as you face the screen about
four rows from the rear of the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how many seats over from the right aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I would say probably three or four&mdash;I don't remember exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, at that time you were standing behind the screen, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No; we had walked out onto the stage itself and could see
the people sitting in the show&mdash;the house lights had been turned on&mdash;the show
was still going on, but we did walk out onto the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you later learn that the man's name was Brewer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. The man whom I had been talking to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; the shoe salesman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I don't remember what his name is, but I think he did identify
himself and we did have his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you armed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I had my Service .38 revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have it out or was it in your holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I believe I had it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. At that time, after he pointed out the person, Officer McDonald
had started up the left aisle and he stopped and talked to two boys who were
sitting about three rows in front of where Oswald was sitting. I continued up
the north aisle or the left aisle as you would walk toward the screen, and then
Officer McDonald had walked on back to this person who was seated back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was&mdash;he walked over to the right aisle, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. He walked from the right aisle and came in from the person's
right. I was about three rows from&mdash;still in the same aisle, on the left aisle and
about three rows from McDonald and Oswald when I heard him say, "I've got
him," or "This is it," or some words to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear Oswald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Not at that time; no, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. They had a scuffle and I immediately ran to the location.
Officer Hutson had come in the aisle behind Oswald and McDonald and Officer
Walker had come in on the left-hand side and I came up in the front. I grabbed
his left hand and then immediately took my handcuffs out and put them on
his left hand and we brought his right arm around as soon as the gun had been
removed and handcuffed his right arm with both hands behind his back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you see Oswald strike Officer McDonald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With what&mdash;with his fist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. It appeared he struck him with his fist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Right fist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was Officer McDonald doing at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I remember seeing him standing beside Oswald, and when I
arrived where they were, both of them were down in the seat&mdash;Oswald and
McDonald had both fallen down into the seat, and very shortly after I got there,
a gun was pulled, came out of Oswald's belt and was pulled across to their right,
or toward the south aisle of the theatre.</p>

<p>Officer McDonald grabbed the pistol, and the best I can remember, Sergeant
Hill, who had gotten there, said, "I've got the gun," and he took the gun and
we handcuffed Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear any snap of the hammer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I heard something that I thought was a snap. I didn't know
whether it was a snap of a pistol&mdash;I later learned that they were sure it was.
I didn't know whether it was a snap of the gun or whether it was in the seats
someone making the noise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was some noise you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You couldn't identify it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No, sir; I don't think so&mdash;I don't think I could say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody strike Oswald with his fist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No, sir; I didn't see anyone strike him. They had, as I said,
they had gotten back into the seat and officer Hutson had grabbed Oswald from
behind and Officer Walker had him by the left arm and the gun went across and
McDonald had grabbed him by the right hand and Sergeant Hill grabbed the
gun and at this time I handcuffed his left hand. There were several officers
shortly after that arrived at the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any officer there with a shotgun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I don't recall any officers. I know I had seen some officers
with a shotgun, but I don't recall whether any officer had one, but it is possible
that they did have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The men who were struggling with Oswald were first, McDonald,
and <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was the other man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Now, Officer Hutson had gotten behind Oswald prior to the
time I got there and then also Walker was on the left-hand side&mdash;on the left
hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald's left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Oswald's left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was on the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. McDonald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what about Bob Carroll, did he come in there too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Well, I'm sure Bob was in there. I couldn't say where he was
exactly or&mdash;I do remember Sergeant Hill being there, and I believe he said,
"I've got the gun." I think I read an account of where Bob Carroll may have
had the gun, but I was under the impression it was Sergeant Hill. I'm sure
Bob was there, but I don't know exactly&mdash;it was all happening pretty fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did any one of these men you have described around Oswald have
a shotgun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I don't believe any of them&mdash;at the time that they were standing
directly around Oswald, had a shotgun&mdash;I may be mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A witness testified yesterday that while they were struggling with
Oswald, a police officer took a gun and took it by the muzzle and struck Oswald
in the back with the rifle butt; did you see anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No; I did not. I couldn't say that it did not happen. I didn't
see from the back, but I do know that Officer Hutson was standing behind him
and had grabbed him around the neck and I'm sure that he did not have a gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Hutson did not have a shotgun?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald say anything during this struggle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I don't recall anything he said during the struggle&mdash;I do
recall some remarks that he made about&mdash;that he had certain rights and that
he would see "about this police brutality" or some remark he made about&mdash;that
he had rights and he wasn't being handled right or something of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody strike Oswald during the struggle except in the
grabbing and holding of him&mdash;I know you grabbed him and held him, but did
you see anybody strike him a blow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No, sir; I did not see anyone strike him a blow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Afterwards, did you notice any marks on Oswald's face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I did notice, not at that time, but I did notice, however, after
I saw him on television that he had a bruise on the right side of his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see that bruise there at the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Not at the theatre; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you with the group of officers that took him from the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I was walking with the group&mdash;I was not immediately beside
Oswald. At this time, I believe, Officer Walker and possibly Officer Lyons
and Paul Bentley and I don't remember, but I believe those three were one of
the three and maybe Sergeant Hill. We handcuffed him and after we had
handcuffed him we walked him out to the left and immediately to the car in
front. They put him in the car&mdash;I was standing beside the car and then I
worked traffic for them to get out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As he was going out of the theatre, was he shouting or yelling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I don't remember him saying anything except this about that
he had certain rights and the police brutality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say that as he was leaving the theatre, or did he say that
in the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. It seemed like we were still in the theatre. After we got
outside, I couldn't hear him say anything. There was a large crowd out front
and they all started yelling when we came out the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A witness testified yesterday that as the police brought Oswald
from the theatre to the car, that two men were standing beside him, were
walking beside him, and that another officer had his arm around his neck
and under his chin so as to close his mouth&mdash;did you see anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I don't remember seeing this. I walked out&mdash;the best I can
remember&mdash;I was behind the group and there were at least three officers, I
am sure, directly around him and maybe more, but I was behind him and
walked up behind him&mdash;I don't recall anyone having him around the neck
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you do any more work on the investigation of the assassination
of the President or the killing of Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No, sir; the only thing I did following this&mdash;we went to the
personnel bureau and made a statement, or wrote a report on the arrest, and
that was the last thing I had done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the pistol at the personnel bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see McDonald mark it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Did I see McDonald mark it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Yes, sir; McDonald, and I believe Sergeant Hill marked it or
possibly Bob Carroll. There were, I believe, two people who marked it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody unload the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. No, sir; not unload it. I believe the gun was unloaded
whenever I got there, but they put Oswald in the car and three or four men
rode with him and then Officer Baggett and I came back to the station and
it was probably 30 to 45 minutes after they got there that we arrived at the
station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I saw the bullets&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever examine them closely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I looked at them and one of them appeared to have a small
indentation where it looked like it might have been struck and did not fire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all, officer.</p>

<p>Now, this will be written up and you can read it and sign it, or you can
waive signature&mdash;just as you wish&mdash;which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. I would just as soon sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, we will have you sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. Will you notify me when you want me to sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will give you a telephone call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. You will give me a telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t96">TESTIMONY OF L.&nbsp;D. MONTGOMERY</h2>

<p>The testimony of L.&nbsp;D. Montgomery was taken at 4:50 p.m., on April 6,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan
and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball, John Hart Ely,
and Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr.
Alfred Goldberg, historian, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you stand up and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before
the Commission will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Be seated and state your name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. L.&nbsp;D. Montgomery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are called before the Commission to give such information
as you have as to the assassination of President Kennedy, and you have
been advised by your superiors, have you, that we have requested your presence
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I have been over here twice now already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have been here before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes; I gave one deposition on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that had to do with what subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, they covered about all of it, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you already testified as to the search of this Texas State
Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, sir; some of that was in there&mdash;yes, sir. Mr. Griffin
took it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ask you about the time you went down to the sixth floor
of the Texas State Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes; I discussed all that, but I don't believe it's in that
deposition; now, I don't believe it was in the typed deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I had better ask you the questions now.</p>

<p>How long have you been on the police force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I have been on down there 9 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Detective in the homicide bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to work that day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Let me see, that morning I was working 8 to 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And to what work were you assigned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, that particular morning at that time we was trying
to round up some hijackers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you sent down to the Texas State Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I got there, I guess&mdash;it was about 12:40 or 12:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I reported to the sixth floor there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take part in the search of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, first I reported to Captain Fritz, my partner and
I, and he assigned us to this position over there where the boxes were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It would be what&mdash;the southeast corner of the building&mdash;over
there from where the shooting took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, was that before the cartridges had been found or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, sir; they had been found when we got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got there they had been found already?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the rifle, had it been found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, sir; it hadn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The rifle was found after you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything else over in the southeast corner of that
sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, sir, as I say, there was a lot of boxes and there was
a sack and there was this pieces of chicken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a piece of chicken over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;there was chicken bones and what not&mdash;it looked
like somebody had been eating chicken there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It was right there with the boxes&mdash;right there on the
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, let me see, there was one piece of chicken on a box
and there was a piece on the floor&mdash;just kind of scattered around right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the paper sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Let's see&mdash;the paper sack&mdash;I don't recall for sure if it
was on the floor or on the box, but I know it was just there&mdash;one of those
pictures might show exactly where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I don't have a picture of the paper sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. You don't? Well, it was there&mdash;I can't recall for sure
if it was on one of the boxes or on the floor there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was over in what corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It would be the southeast corner of the building there
where the shooting was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you turn the sack over to anybody or did you pick it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes&mdash;let's see&mdash;Lieutenant Day and Detective Studebaker
came up and took pictures and everything, and then we took a Dr. Pepper bottle
and that sack that we found that looked like the rifle was wrapped up in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, where was the Dr. Pepper bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It was over a little more to the west of that window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was a sack of chicken bones with that&mdash;near that Dr. Pepper
bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No; the Dr. Pepper bottle, the best I can recall, was sitting
over there by itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the sack with the chicken in it?</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It was right around where the boxes were&mdash;where the
hulls there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The picture was taken of the sack by Mr. Studebaker, and he
said it was the third set of windows near the little two-wheel truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Over there by the Dr. Pepper bottle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I was thinking it was right there&mdash;it was probably that
other sack I'm thinking about&mdash;the one we found on the floor there that was
used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here are two pictures, which are Exhibits H and I in the Studebaker
depositions, which show the paper sack and the Dr. Pepper bottle and a
two-wheel truck, and that is in Exhibit H, and Exhibit I shows the Dr. Pepper
bottle and a two-wheel truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Is this the sack right here, now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's right&mdash;do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I don't remember the sack being right there&mdash;I remember
it was there somewhere, but exactly&mdash;I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Evidently you don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, was there some more chicken some place there also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes&mdash;there would be some more chicken over here around
where the hulls were found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I will show you a picture <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I know there was one piece laying up on top of the box
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a picture which is Exhibit J, which shows some boxes
in the picture that's in the southeast corner there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me where the chicken was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I believe it was right up on these boxes right along in
there. There's some boxes coming along in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Coming along in there&mdash;you mean it's outside of the view of the
pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir; right along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that would be to the north, of that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you see on top of those boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. There was one piece of chicken there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Partially eaten?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes; I believe it was partially eaten&mdash;on that picture right
there&mdash;I was just looking at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's Exhibit J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Right over here is where we found that long piece of paper
that looked like a sack, that the rifle had been in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that have a number&mdash;that area&mdash;where you found that long
piece of paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It's No. 2 right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You found the sack in the area marked 2 on Exhibit J to the Studebaker
deposition. Did you pick the sack up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Which sack are we talking about now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The paper sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. The small one or the larger one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The larger one you mentioned that was in position 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You picked it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Wait just a minute&mdash;no; I didn't pick it up. I believe Mr.
Studebaker did. We left it laying right there so they could check it for prints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you question any witnesses that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Let's see&mdash;that particular day&mdash;no, sir; I don't believe I
talked to a witness that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to any witnesses at any time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Not to the assassination&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to witnesses that had anything to do with the shooting
of Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, we went out and got two of them and brought them
down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Let's see, there was a taxicab driver&mdash;Whaley&mdash;one of them
was Mr. Whaley and there was another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a Mr. Scoggins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. That could be his name&mdash;I just don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have a report that you made of what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I didn't take an affidavit from him&mdash;no, sir; I took one
from Mr. Whaley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you attend a showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, sir; I didn't attend any showups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you took an affidavit from Mr. Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. From Mr. Whaley&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you ever present at any time when Oswald was questioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. That would be the Sunday morning of the 24th, just prior
to transferring him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. That would be in Captain Fritz' office in the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Well, there was Detective Leavelle, Detective Graves, Detective
Dhority, Captain Fritz, and Mr. Sorrels, and Mr. Kelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir; they just asked him several questions there as to
why he shot the President and he said he didn't shoot the President, and
Captain Fritz asked Mr. Sorrels if he would like to ask him a question and Mr.
Sorrels would ask him one and then Mr. Kelley would ask him one&mdash;they would
ask him about life in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. No, sir; that's about all the questions I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, was Oswald handcuffed at that time, during the questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. At that time, I don't believe he was&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you leave with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Did I leave with who&mdash;now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Leave Fritz' office with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. When we started to transfer him, of course, we all went
down on the elevator with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was handcuffed to whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Detective Leavelle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you with the group that was taking him, transporting
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have already testified, I guess, as to what happened there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all. This will be reduced to writing and it can be
submitted to you for your signature, or you can waive signature, if you wish.
Which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. It doesn't make any difference to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to waive your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. I can waive it and save having to come back and sign it</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That will be all right with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. Yes, sir; that's fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you very much for coming back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>. You bet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Employed by the city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you born and raised in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go to school in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you go through high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I finished the eighth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You finished the eighth grade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By way of general background, what kind of work did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I started out working with a dairy, and dairy farm. And went
from that to ice route. From there I went to work at North American Aircraft,
and then the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you go in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Infantry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. 1944. September 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you were discharged in 1946?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. February 1946; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Honorably discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Then I went back to Aircraft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you work in Aircraft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I worked there 11 months that time, and they had a layoff.
I got laid off, and I went back to peddling ice, and peddled ice for about 6
months. Well, one summer. Then that is when I went to Terrell and went
in the dairy business for myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I went to Terrell and went in the dairy business for myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Then I had that 5 years, and then came here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you have been with the Dallas Police Department since what
year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Forty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was your position with the Dallas Police Department in
November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Detective, assigned to the homicide and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you still assigned to that bureau today?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As a detective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the Presidential motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At approximately what time did you find out about the shooting
of the President, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Must have been about 12:40, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after you found out about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Returned to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Returned to your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you been out on duty in a patrol car away from the office
at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir. We had just made an arrest prior to checking out
on a hijacking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have a chance to eat that day or not? I mean lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No, sir; didn't eat lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you got back to the office. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I was instructed by Lieutenant Wells to go to the Texas Book
Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To go to the Texas Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Around 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. To the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular reason why you went to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. When we first arrived, we asked&mdash;we walked into the building
and there was a uniform officer on duty there at the door, and we asked him if
Captain Fritz was there, and he said yes.</p>

<p>And we asked him where, and he said he went on up to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>So at that time we were interested really in contacting Captain Fritz for any
particular assignment he might want to give us, so we went on up to the sixth
floor, and he was there, and that is when he assigned L.&nbsp;D. Montgomery, my
partner and myself to the scene where the shooting occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he assigned it to you, did he say anything that this was
the scene where the shooting occurred, or did he just assign an area at that time
which you later found out to be the scene from which the shooting occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. We had already been there a few minutes when he told us to
stay there and preserve the scene. Actually at the time he told us that, we
knew that that was where the shooting had occurred, because that is, the hulls
were on the floor. We knew all that already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, when you got there, or when you talked to Captain
Fritz, the hulls, the three hulls had already been found in a particular
portion of the sixth floor, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir; I had heard somebody already say. I had already
seen them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mentioned the No. 3, is that how many there were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know or remember what portion of the sixth floor this
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Well, yes; they were underneath a window right near a window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what side of the building was the window on, north, east,
south, or west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. That is east. The window is actually on the south side of
the building, and the window is the farthest east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The window would be the furtherest east window on the south
side of the building, is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you call that the southeast corner of that floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How soon after the hulls were found did you go over to see them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you there when they actually found it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Well, Captain Fritz was already there. There is a possibility&mdash;I
am pretty sure they already found that when we got up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Captain Fritz instruct you to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. To remain there and protect the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Handing you what has already been marked "RLS
Deposition Exhibit G"&mdash;the RLS stands for R.&nbsp;L. Studebaker&mdash;I would ask you
to state if you know, whether or not these shell cases appear to be in the same
position as they were when you saw them there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. There is only two that show in that photograph, that I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I see one, two right by the window. You see those two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then there is one over here, which would be the west, by a box
that is marked from "Scott Foresman &amp; Company." See that there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, I see it. All I can say, at the time these hulls were
mentioned, I went over there and looked. I don't remember them being that
far out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What I am asking is your best recollection. Let's take the hulls
one by one. There are two hulls that appear to be right next to the bricks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Next to the wall; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do they appear to be in the approximate position when you first
saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does the one which is the farthest to the east appear to be as
close to the next one lying at the brick wall as it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Well, of course, I couldn't remember exactly how far. It was
my impression that they were all three next to the wall. I could have been
wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your impression, at least the best of your recollection is that
this third shell which is in the picture next to the book carton, was closer to the
wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I thought they were all three closer to the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When Captain Fritz told you to preserve the scene, what did you
do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Now you got to remember he told L.&nbsp;D. Montgomery, my
partner, and I to preserve the scene, and we remained there near that corner.</p>

<p>Now over to the right, which would be back toward the west of the window,
there was a lunch sack&mdash;a brown paper bag&mdash;and some remnants of fried
chicken, and a pop bottle.</p>

<p>And I stayed closer to that pop bottle while we were waiting for the crime
lab to finish their work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now there was a sack and a pop bottle. Was there anything else
other than the sack and the pop bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. And the remnants of fried chicken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The remnants of fried chicken, was that right by that window,
or was it by another set of windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. That was by some other window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now there are, I believe, on the south side of the building, seven
pairs of windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I didn't count them. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you say it was toward the east, or the west, or the center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Where the sack was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. It would be toward the west. I believe the next set of windows
to my&mdash;I am pretty sure it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You said it would be in the second pair of windows counting
from the east wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. To the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is where you found it, was it between the second and the third
set of windows or between the first and the second, or right by the second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Right by the second pair of windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you stayed over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And your partner, Detective Montgomery, stayed over by the first
pair of windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. By the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the corner window, southwest corner of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Were you there when Lieutenant Day and Studebaker came in to take pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know of your own personal knowledge whether anything
had been moved prior to the time that they took the first set of pictures up
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No, sir; as far as I know, they hadn't been moved. They
weren't supposed to have been, and that was our job to keep them out of there,
and nobody came in there, I am pretty sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, a rifle was found on the sixth floor, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When the rifle was found, did you leave your post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Detective Montgomery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you find anything else up in the southeast corner of the
sixth floor? We have talked about the rifle, we have talked about the shells,
we have talked about the chicken bones and the lunch sack and the pop bottle
by that second pair of windows. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir. We found this brown paper sack or case. It was
made out of heavy wrapping paper. Actually, it looked similar to the paper that
those books was wrapped in. It was just a long narrow paper bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was this found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Right in the corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who found it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I know that the first I saw of it, L.&nbsp;D. Montgomery, my partner,
picked it up off the floor, and it was folded up, and he unfolded it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When it was folded up, was it folded once or refolded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. It was folded and then refolded. It was a fairly small package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now do you know where this sack was with relation to the first
window, counting from the east portion of the south side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. It still would be over toward the east from the windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It would be east of the windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes; right at the corner. Of course, those windows are not
too far from the east wall, but that sack was right in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you what has been marked "RLS Deposition Exhibit"&mdash;that
appears to be G&mdash;it is picture No. 26, there are some pipes that appear to
be in that picture, is that correct? Some vertical pipes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where would the sack have been found with reference to those
vertical pipes? These vertical pipes, I believe, on the south side of the sixth
floor near the east corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. That sack would be over near the corner of the building here
[pointing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would all the sack be east of the pipes, or would part of the sack
be sticking out west of the pipes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. The way it was folded, it would all have to be over here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your testimony then is that all the sack would have been east of
the pipes. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I would say that the sack was folded up here and it was east
of the pipes in the corner. To the best of my memory, that is where my partner
picked it up. I was standing there when he picked it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were standing there when he picked it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, because the Crime Lab was already finished where I was,
and I had already walked off to where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now there was a book carton located, one standing by itself in
that picture&mdash;it would be located northeast of the pipes. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the sack appear to be as long as that book carton was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I didn't compare it to that book carton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Do you remember book cartons there to
the north of where the sack was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir. Actually, these cartons were stacked all the way
around this thing.</p>

<p>I don't know, this book carton right here, unless that is the one that is stacked
there, if I had a picture showing this whole scene&mdash;you see, there was some
other cartons stacked in front of this window. Now I don't know whether this
is the one that was behind them or not. This might be just one sitting out
over there out of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We don't have a picture here that shows all of the cartons, at
least I don't have it right here at the time we are taking this deposition, that
shows all of the cartons, but let <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Just from memory, I would say that that sack would be a
little longer than those book cartons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what is the fact as to whether or not the penned rectangle
on RLS Deposition Exhibit G&mdash;does any portion of that rectangle represent
the place where the paper was found, assuming that is the southeast
corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. It looks like somebody penned that in to show the sack was
laying there. That would show it unfolded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, what you would say then is that the penned portion is
actually longer than the sack before it was unfolded, is that what you are
saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes. It shows to be here, if you are taking this as actual size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Right. Of course, this is photographed at an angle and sometimes
this can be inaccurate insofar as perspective. But would this penned
in be the approximate same distance from the south wall that you saw the
sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Well, I couldn't say exact distance. All I know is my partner
picked that up right out of that corner, and how far it was from the wall in
either direction, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be somewhere in the location of where the penned in
rectangle is on RLS Deposition Exhibit G?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes; it would be in this corner, in the southeast corner of the
building, and there were some pipes on that side. It would be in that corner&mdash;in
the southeast corner of that building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, is there anything else you can remember about that
sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No; other than like I said, my partner picked it up and we
unfolded it and it appeared to be about the same shape as a rifle case would
be. In other words, we made the remark that that is what he probably brought
it in.</p>

<p>That is why, the reason we saved it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you find anything else up in the sixth floor that you feel
might be relevant insofar as the investigation of the assassination is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No; I don't remember anything right off. Anything else that
was preserved as evidence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Other than I know we kept the lunch sack and the Dr. Pepper
bottle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You did keep the lunch sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You did keep the lunch sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. We turned it into the crime lab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean your police department crime lab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever dust it for prints or not, or do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. Well, now, the lunch sack itself, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I don't know whether they did or not. Now that sack we are
talking about, it was dusted right there at the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the long paper sack you found in the southeast corner?
I mean as far as the lunch sack is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No, the lunch sack, I don't know. We turned it in, but I
never did hear after that what he did with it. I am pretty sure they did use it
for something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of that is relevant in any way whatsoever
to the investigation of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. No; I don't remember anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we surely want to thank you for your cooperation, Mr.
Johnson.</p>

<p>You have the right, if you desire, to read the transcription of your testimony
here and then sign the deposition, or you can waive the signing and have the
court reporter send it to us directly in Washington. Do you care to read it, or
do you want to waive the signing of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>. I'd better read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you will be contacted when it is ready.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Seymour Weitzman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Deputy constable, Dallas County.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the location of your place of business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Precinct 1 which is the old courthouse, third floor, room 351.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you educated here in this State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Partially here and Indiana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far did you go through school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I went through college, graduated in engineering, 1945.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you come to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Do you mean back to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Back to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Right after the service was over and when I came out of
the service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you graduate from school before you went into the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I finished up after I received my discharge. I went back to
Indiana to engineering school in South Bend and finished my degree in 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Allison Division of General Motors Engineering School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you went to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Went in business for myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Dresses, garments, ladies garments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I went on the road as district supervisor and manager for
Holly's Dress Shops in New York, 115 Fifth Avenue, and I supervised 26 stores
for them for approximately 15 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I took over as general manager of the Lamont Corp. which
is a discount operation and the headquarters, which was Galveston, Tex. We
had stores in Dallas, Fort Worth, Louisiana, Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz. At
the end of 1960, I closed up all the stores, retired from the discount operation
and went to work for Robie Love in Dallas County, precinct 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You've been there ever since as deputy constable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, around noon, where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I was standing on the corner of Main and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. No, sir; I was with another deputy, Bill Hutton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A deputy constable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; he and I were standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President's car pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; we did. We watched the President pass and we
turned and started back to the courthouse when we heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you turned and were starting back to the courthouse&mdash;what
courthouse and what is the location of that courthouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Sitting on Main, Houston, Record and so forth. We were
at the back side and we turned around and were going into the Main Street
entrance. We made maybe three or four steps when we heard what we
thought at that time was either a rifle shot or a firecracker, I mean at that
second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Three distinct shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How were they spaced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. First one, then the second two seemed to be simultaneously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the first and then there was a pause?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. There was a little period in between the second and third shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the longest, between the first and second or the second
and third shot; which had the longest time lapse in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Between the first and second shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I immediately ran toward the President's car. Of course,
it was speeding away and somebody said the shots or the firecrackers, whatever
it was at that time, we still didn't know the President was shot, came from
the wall. I immediately scaled that wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the location of that wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. It would be between the railroad overpass and I can't remember
the name of that little street that runs off Elm; it's cater-corner&mdash;the
section there between the&mdash;what do you call it&mdash;the monument section?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's where Elm actually dead ends?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; I scaled the wall and, apparently, my hands grabbed
steampipes. I burned them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go into the railroad yards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you notice in the railroad yards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. We noticed numerous kinds of footprints that did not make
sense because they were going different directions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there other people there besides you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; other officers, Secret Service as well, and somebody
started, there was something red in the street and I went back over the wall
and somebody brought me a piece of what he thought to be a firecracker and
it turned out to be, I believe, I wouldn't quote this, but I turned it over to one
of the Secret Service men and I told them it should go to the lab because it
looked to me like human bone. I later found out it was supposedly a portion of
the President's skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That you picked up off the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What part of the street did you pick this up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. As the President's car was going off, it would be on the left-hand
side of the street. It would be <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The left-hand side <span class="locked">facing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. That would be the south side of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was on the south side of the street. Was it in the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. It was in the street itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the pavement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anywhere near the curb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Approximately, oh, I would say 8 to 12 inches from the curb,
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Off record discussion.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. After that, we entered the building and started to search
floor to floor and we started on the first floor, second floor, third floor and on
up, when we got up to the fifth or sixth floor, I forget, I believe it was the sixth
floor, the chief deputy or whoever was in charge of the floor, I forget the officer's
name, from the sheriff's office, said he wanted that floor torn apart. He wanted
that gun and it was there somewhere, so myself and another officer from the
sheriff's department, I can't remember his name, he and I proceeded until <span class="locked">we&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was his name Boone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. That is correct, Boone and I, and as he was looking over the
rear section of the building, I would say the northwest corner, I was on the
floor looking under the flat at the same time he was looking on the top side and
we saw the gun, I would say, simultaneously and I said, "There it is" and he
started hollering, "We got it." It was covered with boxes. It was well protected
as far as the naked eye because I would venture to say eight or nine of
us stumbled over that gun a couple times before we thoroughly searched the
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you touch it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. No, sir; we made a man-tight barricade until the crime lab
came up and removed the gun itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The crime lab from the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Lieutenant Day and Captain Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I'm not sure what the lieutenant's name was, but I remember
Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Captain Fritz remove anything from the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. After that, I returned to my office and I was called down
to the city that afternoon later to make a statement on what I had seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have three pictures here which I have marked, respectively,
D, E, F. I show you D first. Does that look anything like the location where
you found the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; this is taken the opposite side the flat I was looking
under.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Looking from the top side of this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Well, I would be looking over&mdash;Boone was looking the top
side; I was looking under the flat. We were looking over everything. I was
behind this section of books. I believe there were more books in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean "in here"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. In this area [indicating] because at the time we found the
gun there were no boxes protruding over the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In this area, you mean protruding over the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; it was more hidden than there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you the picture marked E. Does that look anything like
the area where the gun was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you the picture marked F. Is that another picture of the
same area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; as well as I remember, the gun was right in here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you mind making a mark there with a pen? That is on F.
Draw on Exhibit F, draw an arrow. The arrow in ink on F shows the location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Down on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Shows the location of the gun on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anything between the place the gun was found; were
there any boxes between where the gun was found and the stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; there was a row of boxes between the stairway
and the gun because we came up the stairway and we couldn't help but see
it if it was in the open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Take E here and make a mark on E as to the location of the place
where the gun was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Same area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same area and the arrow marks the place where the gun
was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Off record discussion.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the statement that you made to the Dallas Police Department
that afternoon, you referred to the rifle as a 7.65 Mauser bolt action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. In a glance, that's what it looked like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's what it looked like&mdash;did you say that or someone else say
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. No; I said that. I thought it was one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you fairly familiar with rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Fairly familiar because I was in the sporting goods business
awhile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What branch of service were you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. U.S. Air Force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you handle rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Mostly Thompson machine guns and pistols.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the Air Force, what were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I started out as a flying sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You flew the plane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you end up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I ended up flying them; ended up in a prison camp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I was overseas in Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You also said at the time the rifle was found at 1:22 p.m., is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I believe that is correct. I wouldn't commit myself there
because I am not sure; I'm not positive that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In this statement, it says Captain Fritz took charge of the rifle
and ejected one live round from the chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He did eject one live round?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; he did eject one live round, one live round, yes, sir.
You said remove anything from the rifle; I was not considering that a shell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I understand that. Now, in your statement to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, you gave a description of the rifle, how it looked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I said it was a Mauser-type action, didn't I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mauser bolt action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. And at the time I looked at it, I believe I said it was 2.5 scope
on it and I believe I said it was a Weaver but it wasn't; it turned out to be
anything but a Weaver, but that was at a glance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You also said it was a gun metal color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Gray or blue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Blue metal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the rear portion of the bolt was visibly worn, is that worn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the wooden portion of the rifle was what color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. It was a brown, or I would say not a mahogany brown but
dark oak brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Rough wood, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; rough wood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was equipped with a scope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it of Japanese manufacture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I believe it was a 2.5 Weaver at the time I looked at it.
I didn't look that close at it; it just looked like a 2.5 but it turned out to be
a Japanese scope, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Didn't you, when you went over to the railroad yard, talk to
some yardman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I asked a yardman if he had seen or heard anything during
the passing of the President. He said he thought he saw somebody throw something
through a bush and that's when I went back over the fence and that's
when I found the portion of the skull. I thought it was a firecracker portion;
that's what we first were looking for. This was before we knew the President
was dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the yardman tell you where he thought the noise came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. Yes, sir; he pointed out the wall section where there was
a bunch of shrubbery and I believe that's to the right where I went over the
wall where the steampipe was; that would be going north back toward the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all. Do you have any desire to read this over and
sign it or will you waive signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Weitzman</span>. I will waive my signature. I don't think the Government
is going to alter my statement any.</p>

<h2 id="t109">TESTIMONY OF CAPT.&nbsp;W. R. WESTBROOK</h2>

<p>The testimony of Capt. W.&nbsp;R. Westbrook was taken at 9 a.m., on April 6,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball, John Hart Ely, and
Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr. Alfred
Goldberg, historian, was present.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you please stand up and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before the
Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. W.&nbsp;R. Westbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. At the present time it is 7642 Daingerfield, Apartment C,
and another address is Route 2, Quinton. I live at both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your business or occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Captain of police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The Commission has asked us to put something in the record
about everybody's past experience. Can you tell me about where you were
born&mdash;they don't get to take a look at you, so they would like to read about
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I was born in Benton, Ark., November 9, 1917. I was a
farm boy and came to Dallas in 1937, and went on the police department
June 13, 1941, and I served as a radio patrolman for approximately 4 years,
promoted to sergeant, and was a sergeant for about 6 or 7 years, and was
promoted to captain in 1952, and have held that position since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What are your duties in general, captain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. At the present time I am personnel officer. We conduct
all background investigations of applicants, both civilian and police, and then
we make&mdash;we investigate all personnel complaints&mdash;not all of them, but the
major ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you wear a uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, it is optional. I don't wear one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you assigned any special duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir; other than just my own routine duties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were those duties that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. 8:15 to 5:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you in uniform on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you heard the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I was in my office and Mrs. Kinney, one of the dispatchers,
came into the office and told us, and of course&mdash;it's the same as everybody says&mdash;we
didn't believe it until a second look at her and I realized it was so, and
so, there's a little confusion right here because everybody became rather excited
right quick, but somebody, and I don't know who it was, came into my
office and said they needed some more men at this Texas Depository Building.</p>

<p>You know, I didn't review my report before I came over here&mdash;I didn't have
a chance. I just came off of vacation and they hit me with this this morning as
soon as I got to the office. I can't recall whether or not it was the dispatcher's
office, but I think it was&mdash;somebody in the dispatcher's office had told us they
needed some more men at the Texas Depository Building, so I sent the men
that were in my office, which were then Sergeants Stringer and Carver, and
possibly Joe Fields and McGee, if they were in there&mdash;it seems like McGee was,
and I think&mdash;I sent them to the building, and then I walked on down the
hall spreading the word and telling the other people that they needed some
men down there, and practically everybody left immediately. I sat around
a while&mdash;really not knowing what to do because of the&mdash;almost all of the
commanding officers and supervisors were out of the city hall and I finally
couldn't stand it any longer, so I started to the Texas Depository Building,
and believe it or not, I walked. There wasn't a car available, and so I walked
from the city hall to the Depository Building, and I would stop on the way
down where there would be a group of people listening to somebody's transistor
radio and I would stop and catch a few false reports, you might say, at that
time, until I reached the building.</p>

<p>Do you want me to continue on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go right ahead, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. After we reached the building, or after I reached the building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
I contacted my sergeant Sgt. R.&nbsp;D. Stringer, and he was standing in front
and so then I went into the building to help start the search and I was on the
first floor and I had walked down an aisle and opened a door onto an outside
loading dock, and when I came out on this dock, one of the men hollered and
said there had been an officer killed in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Well, then, of course, I ran to my radio because I am the personnel officer
and that then became, of course, my greatest interest right at that time, and so,
Sergeant Stringer and I and some patrolman&mdash;I don't recall his name&mdash;then
drove to the immediate vicinity of where Officer Tippit had been shot and killed.</p>

<p>Of course, the body was already gone, the squad car was still there, and
on one occasion as we were approaching this squad car, a call came over the
radio that a suspicious person had been sighted running into the public library
at Marsalis and Jefferson, so we immediately went to that location and it was
a false&mdash;it was just one of the actually&mdash;it was one of the employees of the
library who had heard the news somewhere on the radio and he was running
to tell the other group about Kennedy.</p>

<p>So, we returned to the scene and here I met Bob Barrett, the FBI agent,
and Sergeant Stringer and Barrett and I were together, and then an eyewitness
to the shooting of the officer from across the street, a lady, came to
the car, and she was telling us how this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was your car parked at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It wasn't my car&mdash;we didn't have one. I don't know where
this officer went after he let us out at the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. An officer drove you down to the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. An officer drove us to the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when this lady came up who was an eyewitness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. We were at the squad car&mdash;Tippit's squad car&mdash;it had never
been moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were near 10th and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. And she was telling us what had occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No; the other officers got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it a Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It could have been, sir; I don't recall, because I directed
someone there to be sure and get her name for the report, but she lived directly
across the street, and she told us&mdash;or was in the process of telling us how it
occurred&mdash;what she had seen, when someone hollered a patrolman hollered&mdash;"It's
just come over the radio that they've got a suspicious person in the Texas
Theatre."</p>

<p>Then, Sergeant Stringer, I, and Agent Barrett got in another squad car, and
I don't know what officer was driving this one, but then when we arrived and
were approaching the theatre, I directed the patrolman to turn down into the
alley instead of going around to the front because I figured there would be a
lot of cars at the front. There were two or three at the back.</p>

<p>So, I and Barrett&mdash;Stringer went to another door, and I and Barrett&mdash;we
stopped at the first one&mdash;we got out and walked to this first entrance that was
nearest us, and as we walked into the door we met an employee of the theatre.</p>

<p>Again, I do not know his name, but it was taken, and he pointed&mdash;I don't
think I said anything to him&mdash;I think he told me, he said, "The man you are
looking for&mdash;" Now, right here, Barrett and I became separated for a short
minute or two. I think he was on the other side of the stage, and I'm not for
sure, but this boy reported&mdash;he pointed to a man that was sitting about the
middle&mdash;the middle row of seats pretty close to the back and he said, "That is
the man you are looking for."</p>

<p>And I started toward him and I had taken about two or three steps&mdash;down
the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Down the steps from the stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. From the stage&mdash;yes, sir. Now, I feel sure, and at the time
I think I knew&mdash;I'm not sure if I included that in the report, but I think Barrett
was going down the other steps. I think we separated right there and he got
on the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which side were you on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I was facing the audience&mdash;I would be on the right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Facing the audience&mdash;that would be on the right side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I was on the right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And if you were facing the screen you would have been on the
left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I would have been on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The man that was pointed out to you was sitting next to the aisle,
if you were facing the screen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, he was sitting in the middle row of seats, and I don't
know just exactly which&mdash;it was the third or fourth row from the back, it
seemed like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And near what aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. He was about the middle of the aisle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was about the middle of the aisle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes; about the middle of the aisle. So, about the time
I reached the first step or maybe the second step, I noticed then Officer McDonald&mdash;of
course, the stage was still dim, but I could tell it was McDonald.
I know him. He used to work for me when I was radio patrolman, and I seen
him go down the aisle and this boy come up and made a contact, and they started
struggling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say "the boy come up," what did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. He got up from the seat and they started fighting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the lights on in the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Very dim ones; the picture was still running, but the lights
were on very dim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They started fighting&mdash;what sort of fighting did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, I know that I seen Oswald swing at McDonald and
McDonald grab him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald swung with which arm, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I would say it would be his left fist, because from the way
he was sitting facing me&mdash;I would say it would be his left fist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, the next thing, of course, then I started running and
there was probably six or seven officers that just converged on him just like
that. Barrett was, I think, directly behind me in the aisle&mdash;he got there at
the same time I did.</p>

<p>I yelled about two or three times, "Has somebody got his gun," and finally
some officer&mdash;I don't know which one it was&mdash;says, "Yes; I have the gun."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you close enough to hear anything said by either McDonald
or anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I heard Oswald say something about police brutality&mdash;Oswald
yelled something about police brutality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When McDonald first approached the man in the seats did you
hear McDonald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I probably couldn't have heard this, Mr. Ball, from where
I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear the man say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. The word "brutality" or "police brutality" and I think that
was just all he yelled&mdash;was said while I was in the aisle walking down to the
group. There was about six or seven ahold of him at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the handcuffs on him at the time you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. They were putting the handcuffs on him&mdash;they had one
handcuff on one hand and they were trying to find the other one, and they were
having difficulty in locating it because there were so many hands there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many officers were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. In fact&mdash;that was one of the only humorous things about the
whole thing&mdash;somebody did get ahold of the wrong arm and they were twisting
it behind Oswald's back and somebody yelled&mdash;I remember that, "My God, you
got mine." I think it was just an arm that come up out of the crowd that
somebody grabbed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any police officer strike Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We had a witness here Thursday, a patron of the theatre at the
time, who said that at the time the officers were struggling with Oswald he saw
another officer who had a shotgun take the shotgun and grab it by the muzzle
and strike Oswald in the back with the butt of the shotgun; did you see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir; I didn't see that. It could have happened without
me seeing it because half of my view was blocked from the struggle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody ever tell you that story before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. That's the first time I've heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the first time you have ever heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. That's the first time I have ever heard any shotgun was in
play.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did any of the men who were approaching Oswald or who approached
Oswald have a gun in their hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I didn't see a gun, Mr. Ball; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any men with shotguns in the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. In the theatre&mdash;I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any at any other time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir; I had one myself at the library.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But did you enter the theatre with a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any officer either in uniform or out of uniform within
the theatre itself that was armed with a shotgun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir&mdash;not that I recall, but of course at that time I wasn't
looking for one. You know, if I had been looking for one, I probably would
have seen one, because I feel sure there must have been somebody come in with
a shotgun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you in uniform at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened after that, Officer Westbrook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, after Oswald was handcuffed, and I was then&mdash;some
way I got in the aisle in front of Oswald&mdash;where this was going on, and I
looked right into his face, closer than you and I, about like <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's close to a foot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes; I'd say 10 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ten inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. And I asked him his name and he didn't answer, and so that
was the only thing. Then I yelled&mdash;there was so much confusion and it was
rather loud, and I yelled at the top of my voice, I said, "Get him out of here.
Get him in the squad car and head straight to the city hall and notify them you
are on the way." And so they immediately left with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you the senior officer there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Possibly&mdash;I don't think there was another captain there.
There was a lieutenant and then I ordered all of them to be sure and take the
names of everyone in the theatre at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have asked for names of people in the theatre and we have only
come up with the name of George Applin. Do you know of any others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. He possibly might have been the only one in there at the
time&mdash;the rest of them might have been working there, because I'm sure at
that time of day you would have more employees than you would have patrons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't take the names of any of the patrons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any marks on Oswald's face as you looked at him, as
close to him as you did in the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It seemed like there was a scratch or something&mdash;I don't
remember exactly&mdash;when I looked at him&mdash;maybe a slight discoloration, or it
might have been bleeding slightly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Under the right eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I believe it would be&mdash;you&mdash;yes, sir; it would be under the
right eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is a picture, and who are the officers in the picture?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Sergeant Warren on the <span class="locked">right&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Wilson F. Warren, and this kid on the left&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I
don't know his name. Of course, I know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's Sergeant Warren on the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. He is jail supervisor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you know when the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in this picture it looks like there was some mark on Oswald's
face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, it looks like it might have been a little discoloration
there&mdash;I think in the mug shot that shows up quite a bit more so than it does
there, but you can see some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And also on the left eye and right forehead, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, I don't recall anything, but that little bruise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The bruise under the eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. The bruise under the eye whenever I looked at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Under which eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I think it was the right eye&mdash;no, wait a minute, that would
be the left eye&mdash;left eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You do recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. The one that was facing me&mdash;he was facing me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recall a bruise under the left eye&mdash;when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. When I looked at him in the theatre, but why, as many
officers as there were ahold of him, how he got out from under all the group
without more than that, I don't know. Just accidentally trying to straighten
up, with as many officers as there were there&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you think you do recall that bruise under the left eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Maybe I should put that this way, Mr. Ball, a bruise under
the eye, because I can't be definite about which eye, but just from the picture I
see, but I know I saw that bruise and due to the fact that he had hollered
"brutality"&mdash;well I'm getting ahead of myself here, so I'll just quit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Due to the fact that he had hollered "brutality," as soon as
Mr. McDonald had arrived at the city hall with the scratch on his face, I sent
him on upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As soon as Oswald arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No; as soon as McDonald arrived. I had nothing to do with
Oswald after he got to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you also see a scratch on McDonald's face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I don't remember which side, but it was a rather long scratch
and I had him to go to the Bureau and have his picture made&mdash;there is a picture
of that, which you may have in your possession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was Officer McDonald&mdash;you had his picture taken immediately
of his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will mark this as "Exhibit A" in your deposition.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Westbrook's Exhibit A," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, from there on I had nothing to do with him&mdash;with
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him taken from the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir; because I went the other way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes; he went out the front and I never saw Oswald again&mdash;that's
the last time I saw him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I went back to the city hall and resumed my desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever find some clothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. That was before, Mr. Ball.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Actually, I didn't find it&mdash;it was pointed out to me by either
some officer that&mdash;that was while we were going over the scene in the close
area where the shooting was concerned, someone pointed out a jacket to me
that was laying under a car and I got the jacket and told the officer to take
the license number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did this happen? You gave me a sort of a resume of what
you had done, but you omitted this incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I tell you what&mdash;this occurred shortly&mdash;let me think just a
minute. We had been to the library and there is a little bit more conversation
on the radio&mdash;I got on the radio and I asked the dispatcher about along this
time, and I think this was after the library situation, if there had been a command
post set up and who was in charge at the scene, and he told me Sergeant
Owens, and about that time we saw Sergeant Owens pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean by "command post"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, the definition&mdash;the way we place a command post&mdash;maybe
I can use another illustration.</p>

<p>If there is some disaster, generally, as in this particular case, there should
have been a central person in charge, which was Sergeant Owens, as he had
said. The actual command post had not been established, but let me better
explain a command post by a disaster area, like a fire.</p>

<p>In other words, you set it up at a certain location on the corner of Eighth
and Seventh, and you work from there. Now, in this case we didn't have such
a command post set up because one of the main reasons was because it wasn't
defined a disaster area as we normally put it, but then I got out of the car after
we got back in the car at the library and finally I got out of the car over on
Jefferson Street&mdash;I would say about the 300 or 400 block of East Jefferson. No;
that would be West Jefferson&mdash;because 10th comes through&mdash;yes; that would
be West Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that before you went to the scene of the Tippit shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir; that was before we went to that scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was after you left the library?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. After we left the library. I got out of the car and walked
through the parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I don't know&mdash;it may have been a used-car lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It was actually on Jefferson, but the place where this jacket
was found would have been back closer to the alley, Mr. Ball.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The alley of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Between Jefferson and whatever the next street is over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tenth Street is the street north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. What street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You see, the street directly north of Jefferson is 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It would be between Jefferson and 10th Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where with reference to Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, it would be toward town or it would be north of
Patton&mdash;I guess it would be east of Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It would be west of Patton, wouldn't it? Or would it be toward
Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Toward town&mdash;if I could see a map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, here is a map [handed instrument to the witness].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I used to be very familiar with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a map and you can look at it and tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. [Examining instrument.] Now, I've got it located&mdash;here is
the Texas Theatre and I'm on Jefferson now. It would be Cumberland, Storey,
and Crawford&mdash;I would say it would be between Crawford and Storey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Between Crawford and Storey on Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. On Jefferson, between 10th and Jefferson there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be west of Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. That would be west of Patton&mdash;yes, sir; toward the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you came from the library&mdash;where is that library?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. The library is at Marsalis and Jefferson, sir. It must be here
on Turner Plaza right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You drove west on Jefferson, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. We drove west on Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you got out of the car where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. We got out of the car about here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It was between two streets, and I would say it was between
this Storey and Crawford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you get out of the car at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Just more or less searching&mdash;just no particular reason&mdash;just
searching the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were just looking around to see what you could see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes; and at this time I had a shotgun&mdash;I had borrowed a
shotgun from a patrolman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go when you got out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I walked through, and this is a car lot or a parking area,
right along in here, and I don't know whether I am wrong on my location or
not, but I think I'm right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You walked through a car lot, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir; and I think I came out&mdash;is that a church&mdash;there's
a church right there close by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a station anywhere near there, a service station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Oh, there could have been&mdash;yes, sir. There was either a
used-car lot or a parking lot&mdash;that I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, I show you some pictures here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I would recognize it in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is a picture of a Texaco station at the intersection of Crawford
and Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. At Crawford and Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a parking area behind that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. This looks more like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The Texaco station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes&mdash;the Texaco station; and I think where this jacket was
found was right along in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the picture you are looking at is identified as a parking lot,
and on a parking area behind the Texaco service station at the corner of
Crawford and Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You walked through there, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I walked through from Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. There is an old house&mdash;the only thing&mdash;I come down by this
station there&mdash;there is an old house there and some of the officers were looking
it over. They had seen somebody go in it and there was quite a few officers
there so I didn't pay any further attention to it. So, I walked on, and possibly&mdash;this
may be it&mdash;it appears to be it right here in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an arrow showing the old house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I think this is it right here&mdash;I can't be positive, but I think
that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Make an arrow with a pen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. The arrow marks the point of an old house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That you walked toward, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have marked that old house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what did you do and what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, there were several officers&mdash;there were some at the
back and there were some in the front, and so I just hesitated a moment and
then I walked on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You walked where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I think I come up this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By "this way" you mean towards the parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Towards the parking lot&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Behind the Texaco service station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes; behind the Texaco service station, and some officer, I
feel sure it was an officer, I still can't be positive&mdash;pointed this jacket out to me
and it was laying slightly under the rear of one of the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a car was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. That, I couldn't tell you. I told the officer to take the make
and the license number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take the number yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the name of the officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I couldn't tell you that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I offer this as Exhibit B, which is identified as "37. Parking area
behind Texaco station," and on which the witness has marked "old house."</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Westbrook Exhibit No. B," for
identification.)</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Westbrook Exhibit No. C," for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you another picture which is identified as "38. Place where
jacket found behind Oldsmobile, License No. NL 95."</p>

<p>Does that look anything like the area where you saw the jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I would say that the jacket probably, if this is the area, was
probably right along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a circle there in the general area.</p>

<p>(Witness complied with request of Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The jacket was underneath a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. But, I am guessing on this&mdash;slightly underneath a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean you are guessing on this&mdash;what are you guessing
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. About where the jacket was found in this picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean it was <span class="locked">under&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It was under a car, but I don't know whether it was under
the one I put it under or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It might have been under one or the other of the cars, you couldn't
swear which?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, it could have been under any of the other cars, but I
think it was kind of along in the middle of the parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I offer this as Exhibit B of Captain Westbrook's deposition.</p>

<p>Now, you don't know the name of the officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No; I probably knew his name, but we see so many things
that were happening so fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recognize anything in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. (Examining instrument referred to.) No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is No. 39, which I identify for the record.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Westbrook Exhibit No. D," "39.
View of alley behind Texaco station parking lot.")</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. I still think this is the house here&mdash;I think this is the old
house and this is the parking lot and I would say the jacket was found behind
this row of cars. It seemed to me like there was some&mdash;more room from
where the cars were from what is shown there&mdash;back this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Point out the old house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. This one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mark it.</p>

<p>(Witness marked instrument referred to as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Point out the row of cars where the jacket was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Well, that, I don't believe I could <span class="locked">do&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it near the alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It was near&mdash;but not this close&mdash;it don't seem to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Not as close as shown in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It don't seem to me&mdash;I can't remember for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I offer this exhibit, Westbrook No. D.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Now, I did, when I left this scene, I turned this jacket over
to one of the officers and I went by that church, I think, and I think that would
be on 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit 162, do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. That is exactly the jacket we found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the jacket you found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you turned it over to whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Now, it was to this officer&mdash;that got the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does your report show the name of the officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir; it doesn't. When things like this happen&mdash;it was
happening so fast you don't remember those things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, it was after that you went over to 10th and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. To 10th and Patton&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And from there you went to the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes; from there we went to the theatre, and I can't remember
exactly how that I got back with Bob Barrett and Stringer, but anyway, we
got together again&mdash;probably at 10th and Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you in the personnel office at a time that a gun was
brought in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes, sir; it was brought to my office when it shouldn't have
been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But it was brought to your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was marked by some officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. It was marked by Officer Jerry Hill and a couple or three
more, and when they come in with the gun, I just went on down and told
Captain Fritz that the gun was in my office and he sent a man up after it.
I didn't take it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see McDonald mark it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. He possibly could have&mdash;he was in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the gun unloaded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir; I didn't see it unloaded. When I saw it, the gun
was laying on Mr. McGee's desk and the shells were out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look at any of the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look the gun over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Yes; I have one. Captain, you mentioned that you had left orders
for somebody to take the names of everybody in the theatre, and you also
stated you did not have this list; do you know who has it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. No; possibly Lieutenant Cunningham will know, but I don't
know who has the list.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. And I'm sorry that I'm so vague on names, but it's just&mdash;the
only reason that I knew Sergeant Stringer, I think, that day he worked
with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all. Thank you very much, captain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>. Thank you, sir, Mr. Ball, it has been a pleasure.</p>

<h2 id="t119">TESTIMONY OF ELMER L. BOYD</h2>

<p>The testimony of Elmer L. Boyd was taken at 11 a.m., on April 6, 1964, in the
office of the U.&nbsp;S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball, John Hart Ely and Samuel A. Stern,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr. Alfred Goldberg, historian,
was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Boyd, do you swear that the testimony you are about to give
before this Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Elmer L. Boyd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I am a detective in the homicide and robbery bureau for the Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You received a letter asking you to appear here today, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think they received one over at the office and they notified me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have been told the purpose of this investigation is to inquire
into the facts and circumstances surrounding the assassination of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I'm going to ask you what you learned during the course of your
investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, can you tell me something about yourself, where you were
born and where you went to school and what you have done most of your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, yes, sir. I can tell you I was born in Navarro County&mdash;the
particular place was Blooming Grove, Tex., and it's about 15 miles west of
Corsicana, and I was raised up about 7 miles north of there. I attended school,
well, I started at a little country school&mdash;it was Pecan, was the name of the
school. I went there 2 years and then they sent me to Blooming Grove and
I started to school in my second grade. The reason I was in the second grade&mdash;I
had to go through a primer before I got in the first grade&mdash;I didn't fail&mdash;I just
had to go through this primer before I got in the first grade, and I graduated
from high school at Blooming Grove in 1946 and I went into the Navy and served
for 2 years, I believe I served about 22 months in the Navy&mdash;I joined and I went
through boot training at San Diego, went from there to Newport, R.&nbsp;I., and
caught my first ship, the USS Kenneth D. Bailey. I don't recall just how many
months I spent on that&mdash;somewhere around 15 or 16 months, I've forgotten, and
then they sent me to&mdash;I transferred from that ship and went on the USS Cone,
that's another destroyer [spelling] C-o-n-e, and along about the first part of
January, I believe, in 1948, they transferred me to Pensacola where I caught my
third destroyer, the USS Forrest Royal, and we operated in and out of there
until I got out of the Navy, and I believe it was about the first day of April
1948, when I was discharged, and I came to Dallas and I have been here in Dallas
ever since.</p>

<p>I went to work on the police department May 19, 1952. Prior to that I worked,
I believe, about 3 years for the gas company and I started out reading gas
meters, and then I went into collecting, and I was a collector for the gas company
when I came on the police department. I think I worked a couple of more
places before then&mdash;one for a printing company down here on Cockrell, down
here by Sears &amp; Roebuck for a while, but I didn't stay there long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been in homicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I came in there on October 15, I believe, in 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. November 22, 1963, what were your hours of duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, my hours of duty on November 22, 1963, I believe, was 4 to
midnight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So, on that day you went to work earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I came to work at 9 o'clock. Is it all right for me to go by this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see you have there a report that is entitled "Report on Officer's
Duty in Regard to the President's Murder, R.&nbsp;M. Sims, No. 629, and E.&nbsp;L. Boyd,
No. 840."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; we are partners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you prepare that report yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He and I together prepared it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you prepare it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;the last part of November&mdash;I'm not sure of the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it within a week after the events took place that are recorded
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I would say so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You dictated it to a secretary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I wrote it out in longhand and carried it to the secretary and
she typed it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was written out in your longhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have those longhand notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This report has already been attached to Officer Sims' deposition as
Exhibit A, so we have read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. During the course of your work, did you make notes of what you
were doing in a notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I made notes, and I believe I had a notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make it a habit of carrying a notebook with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you just jot things down as they occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have that notebook with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know where it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; right offhand, I don't know where it is. Part of the time,
you know, I just took a sheet of paper and put down the particular times, you
know, and after I fixed this&mdash;I don't recall what I did with it. I may have torn
it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't have a regular notebook that you kept with you at all
times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I had a regular notebook, but I didn't put everything in it, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This notebook that you had on November 22, 1963, have anything
in it with respect to what you did on the 22d and the 23d of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Of 1963&mdash;I don't recall if I have these showups in there or not&mdash;it
seems like I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have it with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you get it for me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I probably could if I have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you look it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I will look for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I'll be down to the police department tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock and will you look it up between now and then and then let me see it if you
still have it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I'll be up there in your department&mdash;near Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. What time&mdash;at 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 10 o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I'll be there&mdash;I come on at 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You come on at 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, I'll see you in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On this morning of November 22, you had been ordered to work
early; why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, President Kennedy was coming into Dallas and I was assigned
to work with Captain Fritz and Detective Sims out at the Trade Mart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you hear that the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; I heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard that over the radio, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I believe it was around 12:40 when Chief Stevenson called and
he talked to Captain Fritz out at the Trade Mart and he told him that&mdash;Captain
Fritz told me that Chief Stevenson told him that the President had been involved
in an accident down at the triple underpass and was on his way to Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. When we got out of the car, we checked, I believe, with&mdash;Mr. Sims
called in on the radio and they told us he had been shot and we went to Parkland
Hospital and pulled up to the emergency and saw there were a lot of people out
there, but we saw Chief Curry out in front of the emergency there and he advised
us to go back down to the scene of where we thought the shooting had occurred,
down at the Texas Book Depository, and Mr. Sims and Captain Fritz and Sheriff
Decker was also out there, and he rode back down with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went to the School Depository Building, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were told by Chief Curry to go to the School Depository
Building at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; down at the scene and that's where we had heard that they
thought that the shot came from&mdash;from the Texas Book Store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you first heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We were at the Trade Mart when we heard that&mdash;pulling out&mdash;we
were on our way to Parkland Hospital from the Trade Mart, pulling out in the
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you arrived down here at the building, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, we went outside the building and we made two or three stops
going up, you know, at different floors, and when we got up to the top floor&mdash;I
believe it was the top one&mdash;I think it's the seventh floor, and someone called us
and said they had found some hulls, rifle hulls, down on the sixth floor, I believe
it was the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were with whom at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I was with Captain Fritz and Detective Sims.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We stopped at the sixth floor&mdash;you say, did we go down to the
sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you heard that they found some hulls, just tell us what you
did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We went down to the sixth floor and found the hulls over on the
southeast corner of the building and they had some books, I suppose it was
books&mdash;boxes of books stacked up back over there that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the hulls on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything else around there where the hulls were on
the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, over to the west there was some paper sacks, and I think
some chicken bones up on top of some boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Near the windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; they were near the windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far west from where the hulls were located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Oh, I would say roughly between 30 and 40 feet, probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where, with reference to the rows of windows&mdash;there are pairs of
windows&mdash;how many pairs of windows away from where the hulls were located
did you see the paper sack and chicken bones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;I don't recall just how many rows of windows from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
there it was. They are in rows of two, now, I'm not sure, I think it was in front
of the third or fourth window over from the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Third or fourth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Pair of windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; now&mdash;pair of windows&mdash;let's see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The windows are in pairs on that side, on the Elm Street side&mdash;now,
what sort of sack was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. The best I remember it was just a brown paper sack&mdash;it looked like
a lunch sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About the size of a lunch sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any other paper sack around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall any if I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any brown wrapping paper near the window where the
hulls were found, near the windows alongside which the hulls were found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I just saw those stacks of books up there, and after we had been
up there a while, I saw a rifle back over toward the southwest corner over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. It was down between some boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you see any pictures taken of the hulls, photographs taken
of the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let's see, Detective Studebaker and Lieutenant Day, I believe,
came up there and they were taking pictures over there at the scene of the hulls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what about where the rifle was found, did you see pictures
taken there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; I saw pictures taken over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Lieutenant Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything else on the sixth floor there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I saw a lot of officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you find anything yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Not on the sixth floor&mdash;I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you leave there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I think I've got it down here somewhere&mdash;near 2 o'clock&mdash;I
believe, but let me check to make sure. It would have been between 1:30 and
2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you heard the rifle had been found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I was over near the scene of where the shells had been found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Captain Fritz handle the rifle after it had been found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him eject anything from it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see, now, I believe they did get a shell out of it after
Lieutenant Day came over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see it, or are you just telling us what you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I don't believe I saw him get it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You left there and went up to the police department, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, when we left there, we started to go to Irving, but someone&mdash;when
we got downstairs&mdash;someone told Captain Fritz that Sheriff Decker wanted
to see him over in his office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you started to go where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you get the address in Irving, Tex., or the place to go
to in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Captain Fritz got it from some man there on the sixth floor. He
came up and talked to him a minute and then he told Mr. Sims and I that we
should check this Lee Harvey Oswald out, and that was the address they gave
us&mdash;it was in Irving, Tex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We started to go over there and when we got downstairs, like I
said, someone told Captain Fritz that Sheriff Decker wanted to see him a
minute before he left, and we went in there and while we were in there we
learned that the man that had shot Officer Tippit, we thought was the man,
was on his way up to our office and Captain Fritz wanted to go by there and we
carried him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were in Decker's office when you heard that a man had been
arrested for the murder of Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; we heard about Tippit getting shot when we were up on
the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, Fritz told you to go to Irving, didn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; we started to Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you heard the man had been arrested, the
suspect for the murder of Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I think we was still in the Texas Book Depository when
we heard about him being arrested over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to Decker's office with Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you went with Fritz up to your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did Fritz send somebody else out to Irving, or do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think later on, I believe, he sent someone else out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He told you to stay there at the police department, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, we went in and there was a good many people there&mdash;I
don't recall who all was there&mdash;I know we talked to Lieutenant Baker, and
he told us that the man that shot Tippit was in the interrogation room and
about 5 minutes or so after we were in the office, we took Lee Harvey Oswald
out of there and brought him into Captain Fritz' office and he talked to him
in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us about what time of day that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I believe it was around 2:20 when we took him out in there; yes,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was there in the room with Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. With Oswald at that time&mdash;?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took Oswald into Fritz' office about 2:20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was there besides Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, Captain Fritz, and let me see, there was some FBI agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I know one came in just shortly thereafter and I remember Mr.
Bookhout and Mr. Hosty came in right after we got in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who else was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Mr. Hall and Mr. Sims; M.&nbsp;G. Hall is our other partner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He's your other partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Sims was there, and was there a Secret Service man in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;I think there was a Secret Service man there, but I
don't recall&mdash;I don't know what his name was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I don't remember exactly what was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, in general, what was the substance of what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Give me the substance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I knew Captain Fritz asked him his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think he told us his name. I think when he asked him&mdash;I'm sure
he told him his name because he would talk for a while and then he would
quit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ask him where he lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; I think he asked him where he lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He said he lived over on Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he give the address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I believe that he said, well, I know he gave an address&mdash;I know
he gave an address but he didn't say if it was north or south&mdash;I remember
that&mdash;he didn't say if it was North Beckley or South Beckley and I remember
another thing&mdash;Mr. Hosty came in and identified him himself, you know, as
he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean "identified him"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He took his identification out of his pocket and put it down there
in front of him and told him who he was with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He told Oswald his name and who he was with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, they participated in the interrogation&mdash;Mr. Hosty asked him
some questions and he was pretty upset with Mr. Hosty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean by that, what gave you that impression&mdash;what
happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, just by Oswald's actions, he said he had been to his house
two or three times talking to his wife and he didn't appreciate him coming
out there when he wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that what he said to Hosty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall&mdash;I know Mr. Hosty asked him several questions and
finally he jumped up and hit the desk, Oswald did, and sat down, and like
I say, he was pretty upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he handcuffed at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; I believe he was handcuffed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he handcuffed with his hands behind him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had his hands been handcuffed behind him before he came into
the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I couldn't say if they had or not&mdash;they could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know whether the handcuffs were changed after he got in
the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. They could have been changed after he got in the room&mdash;I'm not
certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who changed them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when Oswald jumped up and struck the desk, he struck the
desk with what? With his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. With his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Hosty ask him before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He had asked him about a trip to Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Mr. Hosty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Oswald say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He told him he hadn't been to Mexico City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall just exactly&mdash;I think that the words that he used
when he was talking to Mr. Hosty was that he had been out there and accosted
his wife, I believe that's the words that he used and like I said, after he talked
to him, he said he didn't appreciate him coming out there to his house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was it that Hosty said before Oswald got up and struck the
desk with his hand&mdash;what question did he ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't remember what the question was. I know it had something
to do with&mdash;let me see&mdash;I'm not sure if he was still talking to him about his
wife or the trip to Mexico City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You remember he did ask him if he took a trip to Mexico?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald said he had not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He said he had not been to Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did Hosty say to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He asked him if he denied being to Mexico City&mdash;I've just forgotten&mdash;it
wasn't too awful long before that&mdash;I don't recall just exactly what
time that he said&mdash;I know it was something recent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Oswald say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He said he had not been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember anything else that was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; right offhand&mdash;I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he ask him anything about Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; something was asked him&mdash;I don't recall who asked him
about that, and he told us about going over to Russia, I believe he was there in
1959, or something like that&mdash;about 1959. I'll tell you, I didn't keep notes in there
because of the fact I was sitting right beside Oswald&mdash;right in front of him&mdash;more
or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody keep notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I saw the FBI man writing&mdash;they had a little book&mdash;across the
table over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have any microphones in there to record the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you as a practice record the interrogations of your prisoners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; we don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did this take&mdash;how long was he questioned at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;we took him down to the first showup right after 4
o'clock, I think I have the exact time here&mdash;4:05 is when we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he in Captain Fritz' office from the time you took him in
there&mdash;what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. At 2:15&ndash;2:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From 2:20 until 4 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you took him into the first showup, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, we left Captain Fritz' office at 4:05.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who picked the men to go in the showup with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Who picked the men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall who picked those men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Sims?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall if he did&mdash;I don't recall who picked those men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who were the men in this showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, one of them's names was&mdash;we call him Bill Perry, his name
is William E. Perry, he's a police officer and he was No. 1; and we had Lee
Oswald, was No. 2; and R.&nbsp;L. Clark was No. 3; and Don Ables was No. 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The No. 4 man was a clerk there in the jail, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I believe he was a clerk down in the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it usual to have police officers show up with prisoners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I have seen them in there before&mdash;I mean&mdash;it isn't done
real often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It's unusual to use officers to showup with prisoners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I would say so, but I know that there has been officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that usual to use Don Ables, the clerk, in a showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is unusual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The usual thing is to have other prisoners come in handcuffed
with the suspect, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know why that wasn't done in this case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you first learn that officers were going to go with you
and with Oswald into the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. When we got ready for the showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anybody direct them to go into the showup with
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say when you got ready for the showup, that would mean
where&mdash;where were you when you heard that officers were going to take part in
the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I guess it was down in the jail office. We took Lee Oswald
down on the elevator and met the rest of them there in the jail office in the lobby
there, to the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you went into the showup, did you search Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you find?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I found five .38 shells, I believe it was five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Live? Live shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I put them in an envelope and put them with the rest of the
property up there to be turned in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you put any mark on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;I can look and see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you Commission Exhibit 592 in an envelope, will you
take a look at that&mdash;at the cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes&mdash;I got my mark on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have your mark on all five of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I have my mark on the first three&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;I have my mark on
all of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On all five of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You put those marks on there, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, looking those cartridges over, can you tell me whether these
five cartridges, which constitute Commission Exhibit 592, are the cartridges
which you took from Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where were you when you put the mark on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I was back up in my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you first took them from Oswald, where did you put them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I put them in my pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And after you were back in the office, you put a mark on them, did
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And turned them over to whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let me see&mdash;it seems like we had a drawer there where we had
some more property, where we put it all in there&mdash;you know, where they had
the other stuff&mdash;I have forgotten just exactly where it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You turned them over to someone in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the showup was conducted and what side of the showup were
you on? Stage side or out front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I was right next to the door on the inside, where you go into
that showup room from the room leading into the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who asked the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;at one of the showups&mdash;I've forgotten whether it was
on this particular one&mdash;whether it was someone out from&mdash;Sims asked him some
questions in one of those showups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever ask any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Not that I recall&mdash;I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How were these men dressed that were in this showup?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let me think&mdash;some of them had coats and slacks and one
of them&mdash;let's see&mdash;I don't recall what color, but some of them&mdash;I don't believe
any of them had a tie on&mdash;the officers had taken their ties off and I think Ables,
I believe, was in his shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Without a tie&mdash;did he have a tie on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ables was in his shirt sleeves. What about the two officers, Perry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Now, I remember Perry had on a coat, but he didn't have his shirt
buttoned back up at the top, I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. As I remember, Clark had on a white shirt. Now, I'm not sure&mdash;well,
I'm not sure if he had on a coat or not, but I remember seeing him in a
white shirt as he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they manacled&mdash;handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; they were handcuffed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All four of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes&mdash;handcuffed together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Oswald have on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, he had on some&mdash;I believe it was dark slacks&mdash;it seems like
it was a brown shirt he had on&mdash;he had on a long-sleeved shirt. It seems
like he had on a jacket when he first came up there&mdash;I'm not too sure about
that jacket&mdash;I know he had on a sport shirt and slacks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, his clothes were a little rougher in character than the other
three, weren't they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The other three were better dressed than Oswald, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, yes, sir; I would say they probably were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald had a shirt that had a frayed elbow, didn't he, a hole in the
elbow, didn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall if he did or not&mdash;I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when they asked questions of Oswald at this showup, did
he reply?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I believe he did at that one&mdash;I believe he did reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he angry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't believe he was too angry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he shout or yell in a loud voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall him shouting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't shout or speak in a loud voice at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he at some other showup protest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I heard he did, but I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I wasn't present at that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You weren't present at any time in which he made any protest of
the type of showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This day&mdash;this first showup&mdash;did he protest that it was not a
fair showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall if he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he at any time tell you after the showup that he didn't think
it was fair to put those men in with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't tell me that&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever tell you that any showup had been unfair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you hear any conversation that went on in the audience
part of the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I couldn't&mdash;I don't recall any of it&mdash;I couldn't hear anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know any of the witnesses that were out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I couldn't see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take any witnesses' statements from people who were
out in the audience?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I took him back&mdash;I took Lee Oswald back to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you get him back there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, we left in there, I think it was 4:20&mdash;I believe&mdash;yes; that
was by my watch. I was just going by my watch; it could have been off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present at that interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let me see&mdash;I don't recall who was up there&mdash;I think there
was an FBI agent and I think a Secret Service man was up there and I don't
recall the names of the ones that was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there only one FBI agent at that interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, it seems like that's all there was up there&mdash;just one. I think
another one came in&mdash;now, I never did know&mdash;there was another one that
came in&mdash;now, I never did know&mdash;then there was another one that came in,
but I didn't ever know if he was Secret Service or an FBI man&mdash;I never did
know. But someone&mdash;I believe, called him back out right after he got in there,
but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the names of the FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How about the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't know their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a Secret Service man there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think there was a Secret Service man there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. More than one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Just one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see if I have it here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Kelley there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Mr. Kelley was there at one interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did this one last that started at 4:20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;I don't know, but at 6:20 we took him back downstairs
for another showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you think it lasted 2 hours, the interrogation in Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, no, sir; I don't think they were in there that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you feed Oswald at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Mr. Hall&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I believe someone asked him if he
wanted anything and he said he didn't. Mr. Hall finally gave him a cup of
coffee&mdash;he finally took a cup of coffee from Mr. Hall&mdash;I don't recall just exactly
the time&mdash;that's M.&nbsp;G. Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He's one of your partners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir [spelling] H-a-l-l, and I think&mdash;let me see&mdash;I know that
he gave him a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, from the time that you first took Oswald into your custody
after 2:15 or so, you said, until you put him in jail that night about 12:20, or
12:30, did he have anything to eat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't believe so because he said he didn't want anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you eat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I ate real late that night&mdash;I don't remember just what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How late?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think I ate around 9 o'clock&mdash;I'm not sure about that&mdash;it could
have been 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in this interrogation that started about 4:20, do you remember
what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Oswald handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; I think he was handcuffed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the handcuffs in front or behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. They were in front of him, I believe, still.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember anything that took place at that interrogation&mdash;anything
that was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir&mdash;I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, at 6:20 there was another showup?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was present at that showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We had the same showup as we had had before and they were
numbered the same as they were before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the men dressed any differently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; they were dressed like they were before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you know who conducted the showup&mdash;asked the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Now, I believe that this is the one that Mr. Sims asked some
questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who it was that asked the questions at the first
showup that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a Mr. Leavelle on duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Mr. Leavelle was down there, I believe, on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ask questions at any of the showups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think he did, but I'm afraid to say for sure because I don't really
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the second showup, did Oswald answer the questions&mdash;at 6:20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; I think he answered the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he angry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall him being angry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he talk louder than the other three men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Not especially that I noticed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear any of the conversation that went on in the audience
part of the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anything that was said to the witnesses, or what
they said to the officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We took him back up to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think it was 6:30 or 7 when we left the showup room when we
took him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present in Captain Fritz' office at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, that was when Justice of the Peace David Johnston [spelling]
J-o-h-n-s-t-o-n, and our assistant district attorney, Bill Alexander, William F.
Alexander, I believe is his true name&mdash;they came in with Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald was there too, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What took place there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, Captain Fritz signed a murder complaint against Lee Harvey
Oswald and that was for the murder of J.&nbsp;D. Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there some conversation that took place there at that time
in front of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was it, that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I believe Judge Johnston, I believe, read the charge to Oswald,
and&mdash;well, I don't recall the rest of that conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what Oswald said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At any time in any of the interrogations did you ever hear of anyone
accuse Oswald of having shot Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;I heard&mdash;I believe I heard Captain Fritz talk to him
about shooting Officer Tippit&mdash;I don't remember what interrogation it was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Oswald say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He said he didn't shoot anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever hear anybody accuse Oswald of shooting the President,
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I remember hearing them talk to him about shooting the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who talked to him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I believe it was Captain Fritz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Oswald say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He said he didn't shoot anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you remember what Oswald said when Judge Johnston
read the charge to Oswald? The charge of murder of Tippit, if he said anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think he said something, but I cannot tell you what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald did make some statement, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I believe he said something&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ask for a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let me see, he wanted to get in touch with a lawyer&mdash;I believe
it was a lawyer by the name of Abt [spelling] A-b-t in New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did he say that? When did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. It was&mdash;either right before the first showup, or right after the first
showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Captain Fritz said he would&mdash;he didn't ask me, he was talking to
Captain Fritz&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This was in Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Fritz say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He said he would see if he could make arrangements later on for
him to use the telephone later on and call him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was anything said about who would pay for the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No mention of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think he said he would call collect&mdash;I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who said that&mdash;Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, after the murder complaint was signed, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let me see, I believe after that was signed, Mr. Clements&mdash;I
believe, came in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. In Captain Fritz' office, and started talking to Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you remember what he asked him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I know he asked him about his name and I think he asked
him where he was born, I think, and he asked him about his life in Russia&mdash;when
he went to Russia and when he came back&mdash;I don't recall all of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Oswald answered the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; I'll tell you&mdash;Oswald, he answered his questions until
he finally&mdash;well, this interrogation was interrupted by another showup, and
after we came back up Mr. Clements continued his interrogation and finally
Oswald told him he was just tired talking and he thought he had talked long
enough and he didn't have anything else to say.</p>

<p>He came in there and he wanted to get a little&mdash;well, he told him he wanted
to get a little of his personal history and background, and Oswald finally got
up and said, "What started out to be a short interrogation turned out to be
rather lengthy," and he said, "I believe I have answered all the questions I
have cared to answer, and I don't care to say anything else."</p>

<p>And sat back down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He stood up and said that, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; he stood up and said it. He just sat back in the chair and
said, "I don't care to talk any more."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The first interrogation by Clements was interrupted, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was interrupted by a showup, and that would be the third
showup that you participated in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that took place at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. It was 7:30, let me see, no&mdash;7:40.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who took part in that showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. You mean the officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; who were the parties in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, the first one was Richard Walter Borchgardt, and No. 2
was Lee Harvey Oswald, and No. 3 was&mdash;I have the wrong name in here&mdash;I
have the last name&mdash;I just asked him his name as he came out in the showup
room there and I understood him to say it was Braswell but it was Brazel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Brazell&mdash;how do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. [Spelling.] Brazel. B-r-a-z-e-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Ellis Carl Brazel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was the third man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was the fourth man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Don Ables was the fourth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there some reason why you changed the parties to the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't know any reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who directed that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't know&mdash;we met them down in the jail office and they had those
three men down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the usual thing&mdash;when you are going to have a showup
and you are in charge of investigation, who picks the people who appear in the
showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, most of the time we call down to the jail office and have
them send us down&mdash;if he's already in jail, we just have them send up there
and get him and just how many we want in the showup and we will tell them to
give us this particular one&mdash;or three or four men&mdash;whatever the case may be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who picks them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. The jailers upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you tell them to get them all the same color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; we always tell them to get them all the same color. I
never have had too much trouble getting them all the same color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the size and weight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Now, we always tell them to get them as near the same size and
age and weight as they can. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In this case you didn't pick the men for the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I didn't know them&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or any of the showups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this third showup took place at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We left the office at 7:40 and it takes, like I say, 2 or 3 minutes
to get downstairs, and we got him back&mdash;we left down there to go back up at
7:55.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who conducted the questioning on this third showup which you
attended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall who did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Oswald's manner in the third showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall him being any different in that showup than the
first two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the appearance of the men in this showup&mdash;let's take
the No. 1 man&mdash;what was his coloring and weight and size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let's see&mdash;this is that Richard Walter Borchgardt. He was
born May 30, 1940, and our records show him to be 5' 9", and 161 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's [spelling] B-o-r-c-h-g-a-r-d-t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. That's [spelling] B-o-r-c-h-g-a-r-d-t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 161 pounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; he had brown hair and blue eyes and fair complexion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he in for, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, he was in for CPW and investigation of burglary and theft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, the second man was who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the third man&mdash;was who?</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Ellis Carl Brazel [spelling] B-r-a-z-e-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's [spelling] B-r-a-z-e-l&mdash;just one "l"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was No. 3 and what is his description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He was born November 24, 1941, and it shows him to be 5' 10",
169 pounds, green eyes, blond hair, ruddy complexion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he in for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think he was in for tickets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean, going too fast&mdash;speeding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir; I believe that's right, or having some overdue tickets&mdash;he
could have been in for something else, but that's what I think he was in for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Don Ables is the fourth man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was the No. 4 man in the first two shows, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. This shows him to be 5' 9", 165 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you have Oswald down for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't have his description down, but I think he told me he was
5' and 8" or 9" and weighed 140-something pounds&mdash;I believe that is what he
told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what happened to Borchgardt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or to Brazel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in this showup, the third showup, was Oswald's manner any
different than it had been the first two showups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall it being any different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he shout, yell, or anything of the sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't believe, because when he got back upstairs there, he started
talking to Mr. Clements again and he didn't get upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did he talk to Mr. Clements? This last time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let's see&mdash;he didn't talk to him but for about half an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, after that what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, after Mr. Clements left, well, in a few minutes Detective
Johnny Hicks and R.&nbsp;L. Studebaker from the crime lab came down to the office,
that's Captain Fritz' office, and Detective Hicks fingerprinted Oswald and Sgt.
Pete Barnes came in, and shortly afterward Capt. George Doughty came down
and stayed just a few minutes and went back up, and he left out and I don't
know where he went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Barnes do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, he helped Johnny Hicks make some paraffin casts of Oswald's
hands and the right side of his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were there when that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I was in and out&mdash;I was in more than I was out. I was in and
out at the time that was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened&mdash;what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. About 11:30 Mr. Sims and I made out some arrest sheets on Lee
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where was Oswald then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He was still up in the homicide office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you question him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, shortly after that Chief Curry and Captain Fritz came in,
and Chief Curry asked us to take Lee Oswald back down into the assembly
room and to take him out in front of the showup stage, and he told us not to
let anyone get near to him or touch him&mdash;if they did&mdash;if anyone even tried it, to
take him immediately to jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We went down there and stayed, I'll say, 5 minutes or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened when you stayed the 5 minutes&mdash;describe what
you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, there was a bunch of news reporters down there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Television cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I believe there was some cameras in there&mdash;I'm not sure about the
cameras&mdash;I know that there was a lot of reporters down there. They had
some cameras on the outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. We took him up there and some of them asked him some questions
and he talked back and forth there for a minute and finally we got him and took
him up in the jail office and carried him on up and put him in the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Oswald angry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Part of the time he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was said&mdash;can you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I remember somebody hollering out back there, "Why did you
shoot the President?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He said, "I didn't shoot anyone."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took him on up there, then, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you put him in jail for the night, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you went home and went to bed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Later on I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to work the next day&mdash;that would be
November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think I got in around 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I arrived at 9:30 and I stayed around the office until 10:25 and
Mr. Sims, Hall, and myself went up and got Lee Oswald out of jail again and
brought him down to my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who told you to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you brought him down to your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, Mr. Fritz and the FBI and Mr. Robert Nash, the U.S. marshal,
and Mr. Kelley of Secret Service were in Captain Fritz' office at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who else was in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;I believe Mr. Sims and Hall, and Captain Fritz were
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Sims said he didn't stay there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, he came back out after we got him down there&mdash;that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You stayed there, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you heard what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us what you heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I know Mr. Nash asked him a question or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't recall what questions he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who else asked questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Captain Fritz talked to him and&mdash;let me see&mdash;I don't remember
if Mr. Bookhout&mdash;it seemed like Mr. Bookhout asked a question or two&mdash;I
believe all of them asked him something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what they asked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what Oswald said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, let me see&mdash;no, sir; I can't recall what he said; like I say,
I didn't keep notes there because I was sitting right near Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Oswald handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes; he was handcuffed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the handcuffs in the front or in the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. They were in the front of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did this questioning last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. It didn't last too awful long&mdash;about an hour or so, I believe, and
we took him back to the jail at 11:30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Then Mr. Sims and Hall and Mr. Dhority, who is another detective in
our bureau&mdash;went out to 1026 North Beckley to recheck Oswald's room out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go out there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have a search warrant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;I'm not sure if I had a search warrant&mdash;I know the
landlady was there and let us in there. I didn't have the search warrant
myself, I'll say that. One of the other officers might have had a search warrant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you didn't have one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I didn't have one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know whether you had one or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I know there was a search warrant gotten but I didn't get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, there was a search warrant issued to search 1026 North
Beckley the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was searched the day before&mdash;you knew that, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you searched it this day, what did you find?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take anything with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took nothing out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't believe so. I think it was pretty clean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of furnishings did you see in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I saw a little bed, just a little small dresser&mdash;it barely would
go in there and you barely did have room enough to walk between the dresser
and the wall. The fact is the whole works were&mdash;wasn't any wider than that&mdash;just
about that wide [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The whole room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. The whole room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It wasn't any wider than how many feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I would say it wasn't over about 12 feet long and about 5 feet wide
or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it have curtains on the windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, it had&mdash;let's see, I'm not sure if it was curtains or blinds.
It had one little bed in there and it barely did have room enough to get in
there and go to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't recall whether it had curtains or blinds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald again that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't believe I did&mdash;let me see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, it says in your report you brought him in at 6:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I didn't do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't do it? You were off duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I wasn't off duty, but I just wasn't at the office at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't think you saw him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I worked late on the night of the 23d so I wouldn't have to come
back early the next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, you were with him on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I wasn't with him on the 24th&mdash;I was watching on the TV at
home&mdash;I wasn't at home&mdash;I was out at my mother-in-law's at Irving, Tex.,
and I called Lieutenant Baker right after I learned about Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I want to ask you a question about Oswald's appearance when
you first saw him. Did he have any marks on his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. He had one markup&mdash;I believe it was on his left eye&mdash;the
thing that I noticed or was noticeable. And I asked him where he got that
and he said, "Well, I struck an officer and he struck me back." He said, "Which
he should have done."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say "He should have done that?" Did Oswald say that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I want the exact words, not your version&mdash;give me the exact
words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I'll tell you&mdash;I asked him how he got this place on his eye, and he
says, "Well, I struck an officer and the officer struck me back, which he should
have done."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Those were the exact words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Those were the exact words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anything else said about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; he didn't seem too much upset about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever complain to you that he had been abused by the
officers at the time of the arrest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever use the term that "police brutality"&mdash;did he ever use
that term to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't remember him ever using the term "police brutality".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever ask you to get him a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; he didn't ask me to get him one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you present at any time when a lawyer visited Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I wasn't present&mdash;we asked him, did he want a lawyer
here&mdash;Captain Fritz the next morning had asked him, and he said he didn't want
a lawyer, he wanted Mr. Abt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have some questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was your impression of Oswald&mdash;the way he handled
himself, what kind of a man did he seem to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I'll tell you, I've never saw another man just exactly like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, you know, he acted like he was intelligent; just as soon as
you would ask him a question, he would just give you the answer right back&mdash;he
didn't hesitate about his answers. I mean, as soon as you would pop him
a question, he would shoot you an answer right back and, like I said, I never
saw a man that could answer questions like he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he seem to be under stress or calm in those terms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, at times he was just as calm as could be, then once in a
while he would&mdash;I don't know just how to tell you, but every now and then he
would be talking and he would be just as calm and the next minute he would
just liable to be&mdash;I mean his attitude, you know, would change, you know,
rather frequently, but most of the time when he would be talking to you he
was rather calm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When it changed, was it for any noticeable reason or did it
change apparently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, most of the time, you know, it was just when somebody
would say something&mdash;some little something he didn't like, and he would&mdash;he
didn't become mad, but the worst thing he did was when he jumped up and
slapped the desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. During the Hosty interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. He seemed to you to understand generally his rights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And do you know that he wasn't required to answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Of course, this was a long day for everybody&mdash;did he seem by
the end of the day still to be in command of himself, or did he appear tired or
particularly worn out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, he didn't appear to be as tired as I felt&mdash;he didn't appear
to be, because I imagine he could have been tired&mdash;he didn't show it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This is quite unnatural&mdash;really rather exceptional; this is, of course,
why you say somewhat unusual, a man accused of killing two people, one of
them the President of the United States, and at the end of the day, he is pretty
well in command?</p>

<p>Can you tell us in any other respect about the kind of person he seemed to
you&mdash;anything else that you observed about him, as you now recall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I don't know&mdash;he just struck me as being the man, you know, who
liked to move around a lot&mdash;I don't know that he did, but he just struck me as
being a man that acted like he was not satisfied and&mdash;in one place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you participated in the search of Oswald and found five
pistol cartridges in his pants pocket, was there any discussion of these bullets
with him; did he say anything, or did you say anything to him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I just asked him, "What were they doing in there," and he said,
"I just had them in my pocket."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The memorandum mentions the cartridges&mdash;bus transfer, except
that he had a ring on his finger which he took off and he gave it to Mr. Sims,
Do you remember any other items that he had that you got from him during
this search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No, sir; I know that Mr. Sims did get the bus transfer and took
his ring&mdash;he took his ring off and give it to Mr. Sims, and I got those five shells,
and that's all that I recall being taken from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you remember an identification bracelet in the course of that
investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Let me see&mdash;I'm trying to think if he had an identification bracelet.</p>

<p>When we were up in Captain Fritz' office the first time&mdash;I recall&mdash;I don't
recall if I saw that bracelet then or not&mdash;it seemed like I did. I know I saw
a little card with his picture on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But this was not something you obtained in your search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That had been obtained earlier, apparently.</p>

<p>That's all. Do you have anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Yes. Mr. Boyd, when you first saw Oswald when you went to the
interrogation room and got him&mdash;do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Who was with him in the interrogation room prior to your arrival?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I am not positive about who was with him&mdash;there's some uniformed
men in there and I believe there was Officer K.&nbsp;E. Lyons, but I would be afraid
to say for sure, because I'm not positive, but I believe that's who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know whether whoever it was there with them, were they
talking to him or questioning him, or don't you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Well, I don't know. I just took it that they were the ones that
brought him into&mdash;into the office up there. They were more or less just waiting
for somebody.</p>

<p>I just assumed they were part of the officers that were out in the Texas
Theatre where they arrested him and transferred down to our office from Oak
Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, referring to the press conference Friday night, I believe you
mentioned that part of the time Oswald seemed angry to you, do you know
what it was that upset him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. When someone called to him and asked him why he shot the President,
that seemed like that's what upset him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know if there is anyone who could tell us who picked the
people in the various lineups&mdash;you don't know exactly, but did you know, is
there anybody you could tell us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I just don't know who it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. On Friday night, about what time did you check Oswald into the
jail there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think it was around 12:20 in the morning, I believe. According
to my watch, I believe that's what I went by&mdash;that's what the time would be,
of course, it could be a few minutes off. We turned him over to the jailers at
12:23 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know whether he was checked out of the jail again after
that time? Late at night&mdash;I realize you checked him out the next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No sir; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You I don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. I believe that's all I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, Mr. Boyd, this will be written up and it will be submitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
you and you can read it over and correct it and sign it if you wish. That's one
procedure you can follow.</p>

<p>Or, this young lady will write it up and we'll send it on to the Commission
as it is if you waive your signature. You have your option&mdash;you can do either
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. I think she probably got it down all right&mdash;I'll trust her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, you are waiving your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you very much, and I am glad to have met you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. Glad to have met you, Mr. Ball.</p>

<h2 id="t137">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT LEE STUDEBAKER</h2>

<p>The testimony of Robert Lee Studebaker was taken at 3:45 p.m., on April 6,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball, John Hart Ely, and Samuel A.
Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr. Alfred Goldberg,
historian, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission
to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. R.&nbsp;L. Studebaker&mdash;Robert Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have been requested to appear here to give testimony in
this inquiry, have you not, by your Chief of Police, who told you that we had a
matter requiring your testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The subject of the testimony is the assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>You made certain investigations on November 22 and 23 and 24 with respect
to that, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What I want to ask you is what you did at that time. Can you tell
me something about yourself, where you were born, where you went to school,
and what your training is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I was born in Niles, Mich., and attended several schools and
have been in Dallas and I have been in the Air Force and came to Dallas in 1950,
and have been in the Police Department since February 8, 1954, and right now
I am a detective in the Crime Scene Service Section of the ID Bureau of the
Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What sort of training did you have for the crime lab work that
you are doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It's just on-the-job training&mdash;you go out with old officers
and learn how to dust for prints and take pictures and fingerprints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you had any special training in identification fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No, sir; we don't classify prints too much where we are.
We just compare them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the technique of lifting a print, as you call it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, it's just using the regular dusting powder that we have
and if you find something that you want to dust, you dust for the print. We
used on this special case up there on those boxes and things, we have a special
powder that we used on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you take a picture of the print&mdash;a photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Of this area, we just taped it to preserve it. We just lift the
print and then tape it to preserve it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By "lifting a print," you mean to make it stand out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Raising it up; yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By means of your dusting powder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. By a chemical, yes. This certain print that was up there,
we used this special powder for cardboard and paper. That's what it's used for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on the 22d of November 1963, were you on duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. 7 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What are your hours&mdash;7 to 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. 7 to 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you get a call to go down to the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I believe we got the call about 1:05&mdash;we was down there
about 1:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And whom did you go with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Lieutenant Day and I answered the call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What equipment did you take with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. We took our camera and fingerprint kits and our truck.
We have a truck that is equipped with all that stuff&mdash;a station wagon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Each one of you had a camera, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No, sir; we just had one camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of camera was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It's a Graflex, a 4 by 5 Speed Graflex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you had some experience in operating a camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, on this certain camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. About 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you have had photography in your crime lab work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Was about 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you done photography altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. In my lifetime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, as one of the assistants in the crime lab, what period of years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. 2 months. I went to the crime lab in October, the 1st of
October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did&mdash;had you done any photography before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Just home photography.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the fingerprint equipment, is that the dusting powder you
mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Just anything we had in the truck. We have the truck
complete.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have different kinds of fingerprint dusting powder for different
substances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many different kinds of powder do you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, we have a gray powder that we use for lifting prints
and use under an ultra-violet light and we have a black volcano powder that
we use on white or grey surfaces, and then just recently we purchased this
new powder&mdash;it's a magnetic powder. It's a new type of powder that you
just use something like a pen to lift your powder out of the jar that it's in and
it will lift a print off of a paper better than your regular dusting powder. It's
more accurate in lifting a print than anything I have ever seen. It's a new
type powder&mdash;a magnetic powder is what it is, and they have a jet black and
a gray and a silver-gray and different types of powder in there that you can
use on different types surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By "lifting the prints," you mean it stands out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Raising the print up, raising the invisible print which is
a latent print and it will raise the moisture out of the paper that it is pressed
on. It takes 7 pounds of pressure to leave a latent fingerprint and the moisture
in your fingers, in the pores of your skin, is what leaves the print on the paper,
but it is invisible until you put your powder on there and then it raises it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on this day when you went to the Texas School Book Depository
Building, did you go directly to some particular floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. We went to the entrance and they said it was on the
sixth floor and we went directly to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, were you directed to some place on the sixth floor, as soon
as you arrived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No; they hadn't found anything when we got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you were there a little while, did somebody find something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. They found the empty hulls in the southeast corner of
the building&mdash;they found three empty hulls and we went over there and took
photographs of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have that photograph with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could I see it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Now, I took two of the photographs and Lieutenant Day
took two. We took double shots on each one. These are the ones I took myself&mdash;these
pictures. There's the two pictures that I took. This one was right
before anything was moved. There is a hull here, a hull here, and a hull over
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this picture you have just identified as the picture you took,
we will mark it as Exhibit "A" in your deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit A,"
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir; now, on this negative right down here in the
bottom corner of this negative, there is another hull&mdash;you can just barely see
the tip of it right here, and when this picture was printed, the exposure of the
printing left this out, but I have one&mdash;I didn't know this was like that, but I
have another one that shows this hull this way.</p>

<p>You see these boxes all right stacked up here, and you couldn't get over
here to take another picture in that way, without getting up on everything and
messing everything up. This is exact before anything was ever moved or
picked up.</p>

<p>There are just two different views there. You probably got one or two recopies.
We printed a bunch of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is this the same picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That's the same picture, only you don't have it there either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It doesn't show it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It doesn't show the third hull laying beside this box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have a picture which shows the three hulls, which is Exhibit
A, and a picture showing the two hulls, will be marked "Exhibit B."</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit B,"
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. The first pictures was shots on the southeast facing west,
and this one here is facing east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, Exhibit A was filmed from the east, with the
camera facing west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Exhibit B is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Facing east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are facing east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. We have a jacket we made up that has all of those pictures
numbered in there, and I believe he made an explanation on every one of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will identify your Exhibit A as your No. 20 and your Exhibit B
as your No. 19. Now, what other pictures did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Of the rifle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir; that's why, right after these were taken, they said
they had found a rifle and to bring the cameras over to the northwest corner of
the building where the rifle was found and I loaded everything up and carried
it over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take a picture of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir; on these, Lieutenant Day also took pictures of
those, and he also took pictures of this gun. We took two shots apiece.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's see the shots you took of the place where the gun was located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I know it's mine because my knees are in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember the name of the deputy sheriff that found the
gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have handed me a picture now that I will have marked as
"Exhibit C" and it is your No. 22.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit C," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is a picture taken by you of the location of the gun&mdash;that
was before anyone moved it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have another shot of that other picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No, we took two from the same location when we was up on
top of the stack of boxes shooting down at it, before they picked it up. Actually,
there was four negatives of them of the gun, but they are all in the same location,
shooting straight down and they were taken on different exposures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took some other pictures, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take a picture of the window in the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any boxes on the ledge of this window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take some pictures showing those boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that before any of them were moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That picture right there is the one that shows them, and
the other pictures show them before they were moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean Exhibit A and B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. A and B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have a picture that shows the boxes themselves, just a
shot of those boxes in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. This one, Exhibit A, shows that&mdash;this is the exact&mdash;now,
this print here isn't too good, but you can see the indentation in this box right
here. This is before it was ever moved, and right down below here, you can
see a staple on another box or another negative, this isn't too good a negative
here. If I had known what you wanted, I would have brought you a better
print&mdash;picked out a better print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you say on Exhibit A it shows a box in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. These boxes [indicating], yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the way they were piled up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, just exactly like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you say there is an indentation on that box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That shows in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you take this pen and sort of surround that and make it
look a little heavier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. (Marked exhibit as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was an indentation in the box, was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, and you can tell on these boxes. We checked them all
over and this box is a Second Rolling Readers&mdash;that was carried from the fourth
aisle over here to over here (indicating) and there is another box that was
taken off of this stack&mdash;this stack right here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it shown in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It will show on another negative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You see, somebody reading this can't tell what you mean by "another
box taken from this stack here."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, there is a box right under this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right under what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Right under this box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the box that's shown in the window ledge, you mean the
little Rolling Readers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. There are two boxes stacked up here&mdash;here's one, and here's
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they both Rolling Readers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes; two small boxes, and then a large box with these books
was underneath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It's marked "books"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It's marked "books" and it was underneath this box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the box marked "books" was underneath the box marked
"Rolling Readers"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes; Second Rolling Readers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, there were two Rolling Readers boxes, weren't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were they taken from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. They were taken from the fourth aisle and put there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were they stacked in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, this shows as much as you can before anything was
moved, and at that time, we went over to this other <span class="locked">place&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir; that was after the boxes were dusted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's after they were moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir; that's when we was trying to get some prints right
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any pictures of the boxes before they were moved
other than those you have showed me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Just these two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just the two that show the cartons, and those are Exhibits A and B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. We have probably got one down there I can get you that is a
lot better print than that. If you want a better print, I can get it for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, you don't have any pictures taken of the boxes before they
were moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I will show you another picture which we will mark as
"Exhibit D," was that taken by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit D," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that show the position of the boxes before or after they were
moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That's after they were dusted&mdash;there's fingerprint dust on
every box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And they were not in that position then when you first saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, take a look at it and tell me where were they with reference
to the left window sill, were there boxes over close to the left window sill or in
the center, or close to the right of the window sill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Where is your other picture&mdash;and I will show you?
See this box right here&mdash;this box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We are referring now to the box shown in Exhibit B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That's one of these Rolling Readers there in Exhibit B,
you can read it right here&mdash;it's upside down. It says, "Second Rolling Readers."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That says 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No; it says Second; that's that little Rolling Reader&mdash;it
says "Second Rolling Readers". They don't go by this up there, they go by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
right here, this little print. Now, this box was turned over on its side and you
see the tape right here, the way it is wrapped around&mdash;that was laying in the
window like this on the top box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "In the window like this," you mean as shown on Exhibit B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It is Exhibit B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was on the window ledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was on the window ledge, just like it is right there, and
then this other box was beside it, and this box was turned up on end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say "this box turned up on end," you've got to give us a description
of "this box"&mdash;you mean the box marked "books"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. The box marked "books"&mdash;now, we have&mdash;this thing is stapled
here some place along this edge and you can see the staples in this other print.
You can't see it in this print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What other print?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. When you make a negative, you have to put it on your
exposure when you expose the thing, and you see, you lose part of your negative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. First, let me get back to what we were talking about first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, this box was sitting right here&mdash;the first box in
Exhibit A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wait just a minute&mdash;let me direct your attention to Exhibit B,
does it show a box on the window ledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. This box&mdash;the Second Rolling Readers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That picture was taken before the box was moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That box shown in the window ledge in Exhibit B was the Rolling
Readers box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And underneath that was another box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Another Rolling Reader box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And underneath that sitting on the floor was another box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. A box marked "books".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was larger in size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was larger in size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Than the Rolling Readers box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the one marked "books", how was that standing, was it on its
end or on its side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was on its end. You see, these staples right along here,
these staples show in another print. They don't show in this print&mdash;this is just
a bad print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you say "in this," what is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. This is Exhibit&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Exhibit A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Exhibit A&mdash;it was standing on end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in Exhibit A&mdash;can you tell me looking at Exhibit A whether
or not these boxes were over near the left-hand corner of the sill, to the left
of the sill, looking out of the window, at the center, or over at the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. They were in the left-hand corner of the window looking
towards Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How close to the edge of the sill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Right at the edge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right at the edge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you show an indentation or a mark on the top of the box
shown in Exhibit A, is that a little Rolling Reader box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, we have a picture here which we will mark "Exhibit E."</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit E," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is a picture of the fifth and sixth floor of the Texas School
Book Depository taken by a photographer right after shots were fired at
President Kennedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Can you tell me whether or not the Rolling Readers box you identified in
Exhibit A is shown in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That's the top corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That's this corner right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's put a circle around that so we can identify that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Have you got a ballpoint pen?</p>

<p>(Witness Studebaker marks the instrument referred to as requested by
Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The circle surrounds that box, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is another box shown in Exhibit E here over to the right
of the window as you stand looking out of the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It would be these boxes back over in here&mdash;it would be
the top of those boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far were they away from the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I would have to look at the measurements&mdash;I have the
measurements down here. This is the box you see right there, in that picture.
You see, these boxes were stacked all up on top of each one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are referring to Exhibit A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Exhibit A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it is the row of boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Behind this window&mdash;that's the top of that box&mdash;that's
all it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is the top of a box that is shown in this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And they were set back from the window 2 or 3 feet, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, they were about 18 inches is all that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's make two circles&mdash;one circle around the top of the Rolling
Readers and one circle around the top of the other box. So, the people who
read this can understand it, make the Rolling Readers circle an "X" circle
and mark it out here&mdash;mark "X" and the other circle a "Y" circle.</p>

<p>(Witness Studebaker marked the exhibit referred to as requested by Counsel
Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the Rolling Readers box, which is shown in the "X" circle
on this Exhibit E, where was that with reference to the window sill itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Sitting right on the sill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the box that is shown in the picture as around the "Y" circle
of Exhibit E, that was how far from the window itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Approximately 18 inches from the inside brick of the
window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that little aisleway is shown on Exhibits A and B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, on A and B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you at any time see any paper sack around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Storage room there&mdash;in the southeast corner of the building&mdash;folded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the southeast corner of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was a paper&mdash;I don't know what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was folded, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was it with respect to the three boxes of which the top
two were Rolling Readers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Directly east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a corner there, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir; in the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was in the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I drew that box in for somebody over at the FBI that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
said you wanted it. It is in one of those pictures&mdash;one of the shots after the
duplicate shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's mark this picture "Exhibit F."</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit F," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who took that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recognize the diagram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you draw the diagram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I drew a diagram in there for the FBI, somebody from the
FBI called me down&mdash;I can't think of his name, and he wanted an approximate
location of where the paper was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that show the approximate location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where you have the dotted lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, there is something that looks like steam pipes or water pipes
in the corner there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that with reference to those pipes&mdash;the paper wrapping?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Laying right beside it&mdash;right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it folded over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was doubled&mdash;it was a piece of paper about this long and
it was doubled over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long was it, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I don't know&mdash;I picked it up and dusted it and they took it
down there and sent it to Washington and that's the last I have seen of it, and
I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take a picture of it before you picked it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that sack show in any of the pictures you took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No; it doesn't show in any of the pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it near the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way from the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was east of the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Over in the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Over in the corner&mdash;in the southeast corner of the building,
in the far southeast corner, as far as you can get is where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you dusted it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. With that magnetic powders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you lift any prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. There wasn't but just smudges on it&mdash;is all it was. There
was one little ole piece of a print and I'm sure I put a piece of tape on it to
preserve it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, then, there was a print that you found on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes; just a partial print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The print of a finger or palm or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. You couldn't tell, it was so small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did dust it and lift some print?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you say you taped it, what did you do, cover it with some
paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. We have&mdash;it's like a Magic Mending Tape, only we use it
just strictly for fingerprinting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's stick with the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, on the paper I put a piece of 1 inch tape over it&mdash;I'm
sure I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you dusted the print, you put a 1 inch tape over it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you also lift a print off of the box?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You lifted a print off of a box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. The box was due north of the paper that was found, and it
was, I believe, we have it that it was&mdash;I can read the measurements off of one of
these things&mdash;how far it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fine, do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was 16½ inches from the&mdash;from this wall over here
(indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which wall are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was from the south wall of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take a picture of that box in place before it was moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The box from which you lifted the prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. This box never was moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That box never was moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That box never was moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you took a picture of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that was the location of it when you lifted the print of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And may I have that, please, and we will mark it Exhibit G.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I was with them in the corner all the time&mdash;they were with
me, rather, I guess Captain Fritz told them to stay with us and help us in case
they were needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Johnson and Montgomery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Johnson and Montgomery&mdash;they were with me all the time
over in that one corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, we have here a picture which we will mark "G."</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit G," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is your No. 26, and that shows the box, does it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that was its location with reference to the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir; that's the exact location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you draw in there showing us where the paper sack was found?</p>

<p>(Witness Studebaker drew on instrument as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be directly south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That would be directly south of where the box was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have drawn an outline in ink on the map in the southeast
corner. Now, that box is how many inches, as shown in this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It is 16 inches from the south wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you lifted a print there off of this box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And now, is that shown in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What shows in the picture, can you tell me what shows in the
picture? Describe what you see there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, there is a box with a partial print on the&mdash;it would
be the northwest corner of the box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that a palm print or a fingerprint?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. A palm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was a palm print?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And does it show the direction of the palm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. West.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It would be made with the <span class="locked">hand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. With the right hand sitting on the box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the fingers pointed west, is that it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you outlined that before you took the picture, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that is the outline shown in this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in Exhibit F, does that also show&mdash;did you attempt to show
the diagram of the palm in Exhibit F; did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No; could I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Did I do this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But, does that correspond with your opinion as to the direction
of the hand, the position of the hand at the time the palm print was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There were no fingers shown in that print, just the palm print?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No, sir; just the palm print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you have some more pictures there to show me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, I've got a bunch of them. I made this diagram of
the whole sixth floor of that building. This isn't the original, and J.&nbsp;B. Hicks
and I measured this thing and I drew the diagram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you find a two-wheeled truck up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you take a picture of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me see that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. All right&mdash;it has the Dr. Pepper bottle and the paper sack
that was sitting there in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me see that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. (Handed instrument to Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>There are two different views of it&mdash;there's one and here's one. That was
before anything was touched and before it was dusted. This is a shot&mdash;I believe
that's in the third aisle and let's see what it is marked&mdash;it's the sixth floor
of 411 Elm Street looking south and the third aisle from Houston Street on
the south side of the building. That was taken looking directly into that&mdash;this
is the sack with those chicken bones and all that mess was in there too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is the sack shown there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes; it's a little ole brown sack&mdash;yes; it's right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will mark this as "Exhibit H," which is your No. 6.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit H," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the sack, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it shows&mdash;it has some chicken bones in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any chicken bones in any other place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. None outside the sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No; they were all inside the sack, wrapped up and put
right back in. It had a little piece of Fritos in the sack, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, we will have the next picture marked Exhibit I, which shows
the Dr. Pepper bottle with the two-wheeler, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit I," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that's your No. 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the third row over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That's the third aisle from Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be the third set of windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. That would be the third set of windows&mdash;it would be&mdash;one,
two, three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The third set of windows from Houston Street&mdash;you mark it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the witness Studebaker as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you see a chicken bone over near the boxes in the southeast
corner, over near where you found the cartridges and the paper sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I don't believe there was one there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't see any. One witness, a deputy sheriff named Luke
Looney said he found a piece of chicken partly eaten up on top of one of the
boxes; did you see anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was anything like that called to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I can't recall anything like that. It ought to be in one
of these pictures, if it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You made a map of that sixth floor and identified pictures by
numbers, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You made a measurement of the distance from the window ledge
to the sidewalk, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Let me see&mdash;61 feet from the window ledge to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this is such a good set of pictures, can we have them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. You will have to see Chief Curry. He gave orders that no
pictures were to be released without his permission. You can call him, if you
want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, I already have taken some of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I'm sure he will. We have printed about 10,000 of them&mdash;it
seems like that and I don't imagine that two or three more would make any
difference. This is out of a master set&mdash;all of these pictures you have here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The picture of the boxes; this is after they were moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir; they were moved there. This is exactly the
position they were in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes&mdash;not&mdash;this was after they were moved, but I put them
back in the same exact position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they that close&mdash;that was about the position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take one of these pictures and mark it the next number, which
will be "Exhibit J."</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Studebaker Exhibit J," for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After the boxes of Rolling Readers had been moved, you put them
back in the same position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And took a picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And this is Exhibit J, is it, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Exhibit J, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the box that had the print on it is shown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's put a few hieroglyphics on here&mdash;a few numbers on here.
Let's put the box with the print that was found as 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. You want 1 marked on this box?</p>

<p>(Witness Studebaker marked instrument as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the place where the paper sack was found as No. 2 and the
box that had the indentation on it, let's mark it No. 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. (Marked instruments as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And outline the indentation with a circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. (Witness executed outline as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any other indentation on that box besides that which is
shown in the circle on 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the only one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, you see, I dusted these first, because I figured he might
have stacked them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you find any prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No prints, and then I was standing right there and I told
Johnson and Montgomery that there should be a print, and I turned around and
figured he might have been standing right in there, and I dusted all these poles
here and there wasn't no prints on any of it and started dusting this big box,
No. 1 here, and lifted the print off of that box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you later examine that print that you lifted off of that box
in your crime lab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I was up in that building until 1 o'clock that morning and
got there at 1 and left at 1 and they had seized all of our evidence and I
haven't seen it since.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Day compared the print before it was released to Oswald's print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. He compared it as Oswald's right palm print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you put some masking tape over that bit of cardboard before
you moved it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. As soon as the print was lifted, you see, I taped it and then
they took the print down there. They just took the top corner of this box down
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They just took the top part of the box down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, and when we took this picture, we took it back&mdash;that
stuff has been up there and back until I was so confused I don't know what
was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean, when you took the picture which is marked Exhibit <span class="locked">J&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. This picture has the palm print on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It has the palm print&mdash;it had been removed and had been identified
and brought back and put in the box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It had been brought back and put in the box and as being
Oswald's right palm print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So, in Exhibit J, you put the cardboard back on the box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. On the box, yes, sir; where it was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where you had found it? You put the Rolling Readers boxes
back where you first saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you took a picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So, this Exhibit J, gives us the scene as you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before the boxes were moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And before the palm print was identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you find any prints on that sack that had the chicken bones
in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you find any prints on boxes around where that sack was
found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No, no prints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or the two-wheeler truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You dusted around there for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. I dusted everything around that area. There was just
smears and smudges on the bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you dust the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. No, sir; Lieutenant Day handled the rifle part of it. I
didn't mess with the rifle at all. He took it down to the city hall and they
worked on it down there at the lab.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have the measurements of the boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, I have all the measurements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Down at the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take Exhibit J&mdash;how did the height of the little Rolling Reader
box on the window sill compare with the height of the box you have marked
"3" that had the indentation on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was lower, approximately 3 or 4 inches lower than
the box marked "Exhibit 3, or No. 3" in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which box was lower, tell us which box was lower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. The box on the sill was lower than the box&mdash;do you want
to mark it "4"&mdash;the box in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The box in the window, you mark it "4," if you wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. (Marked instrument as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, tell us which box, identifying it by number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Box No. 4 in the window was approximately 3 to 4 inches
lower than Box No. 3 pictured in the picture of Exhibit J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you have any questions to ask him on any other subject
matters, and if you do go ahead and ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Perhaps this is not the witness to establish it, but I think it
might be useful to know if he has any opinion as to why the boxes were
placed that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. A good gun rest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In that arrangement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, it was a good gun rest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. With the box in front lower than the box behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. In other words, it's like this&mdash;you see&mdash;it would be down
on a level like this&mdash;it shows where the butt of the gun was up behind him
here. He was down like this&mdash;nobody could see him from the street. He was
behind this window. He didn't shoot this way because everybody would be
looking right at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, how big was this paper that you saw&mdash;you saw the wrapper&mdash;tell
me about how big that paper bag was&mdash;how long was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. It was about, I would say, 3½ to 4 feet long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The paper bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how wide was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Approximately 8 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Studebaker, this testimony will be written up and it will be
submitted to you if you wish, for your signature. You can read it over and
sign it, or it is your option that you can waive your signature and we will
send it right on up to the Commission.</p>

<p>Which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Whichever is the easiest for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is easier for you if you don't have to read it, of course, but
you have a right to read it and sign it, whichever you want to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Well, I will read it and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. She will notify you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Studebaker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<h2 id="t149">TESTIMONY OF C.&nbsp;N. DHORITY</h2>

<p>The testimony of C.&nbsp;N. Dhority was taken at 2:45 p.m., on April 6, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball, John Hart Ely, and Samuel A. Stern,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr. Alfred Goldberg, historian
was present.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. My name is Joe Ball. Will you stand up and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you are about to give before the
Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. C.&nbsp;N. Dhority.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Detective with the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You understand, don't you, that we are inquiring here as to the
facts surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have been requested to come up here and give your
testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you are willing to testify to such matters that came to your
attention during your investigation of that assassination, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you tell me something about yourself, where you were born
and what your education is, and how long you have been here with the Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, I was born in Tuscumbia, Ala., in August 1923, and lived
there until I was about 10 years old, and have been in Dallas the rest of the time.</p>

<p>I have been on the police department since August 24, 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What department do you work with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I work for Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Homicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been in the Homicide Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Since 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, what time did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Oh, I believe it was around 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that the time you usually went to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, I was off that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, how did you happen to go to work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Lt. Wells called me and told me to come to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went to work at the main office of the Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You arrived at about 2 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you usually work with another detective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes. H.&nbsp;H. Blessing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he on duty that day with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't believe so. He got shot last December and has been
in pretty bad shape. He just works sometimes and I don't know whether he
was there that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you work with anybody that day, November 22, after you came
to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I worked part of the day with C.&nbsp;W. Brown; he's a patrolman
temporarily assigned to that bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the first thing you did that day after you came to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I started answering telephones, I believe; they were all ringing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you later see Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time was the first time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall exactly what time it was&mdash;he was in Captain
Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, did you ever sit in on the questioning, sit in a
group where Oswald was questioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the first thing that you did that day with respect to
the investigation of the President's assassination?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Around 6 p.m., Detective Brown and myself went out and got
Mr. McWatters from the bus in front of the city hall there and brought him
into the lineup and took an affidavit off of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were with Mr. McWatters, were you, in the lineup during
the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. About 6:30. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You two men were with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was some other people there also at that time, weren't
there; some other witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Quite a few down there as well as I recall, in the showup
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the showup room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to a man named W.&nbsp;W. Whaley at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Whaley, that's a cabdriver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The cabdriver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't believe that was that night&mdash;I was thinking that was
the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did you at some time talk to Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, briefly, I took him back down to the cab company down
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to a fellow at this showup at 6:30, did you talk to
anybody named Sam Guinyard? Or Ted Callaway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But at this showup at 6:30 you and Brown were with McWatters,
were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a Leavelle there, J.&nbsp;R. Leavelle&mdash;a detective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall&mdash;he could have been&mdash;there was quite a few
officers there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what occurred at the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir; he identified Oswald as the No. 2 man in the four-man
lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were any questions asked of the men in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall&mdash;I wasn't holding the showup. I was just with
him and viewing the lineup. I believe that someone up there did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did McWatters say to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. He identified him as the man that rode on the bus and said
he wasn't for sure exactly where he picked him up, but he said he believed
that he got off shortly after he got on the bus, but after he identified him
he went upstairs and looked at a transfer that Detective Sims had took out of
Oswald's pocket, and he positively identified the transfer as his transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took McWatters' affidavit after that, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right after he had made an identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that time, and I'll show you a copy of an affidavit by McWatters,
and will you take a look at that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. [Examined instrument referred to.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Dhority, after the showup, did you take the affidavit from
Mr. McWatters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in the affidavit here he says he picked up a man on the
lower end of town on Elm and Houston and went out on Marsalis and picked
up a woman, and then he mentions that as he went out, "This man was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
grinning and never did say anything. The woman said that it was not a grinning
matter. I don't remember where I let this man off. This man looks
like the No. 2 man I saw in a lineup tonight."</p>

<p>Now, you read that, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you say he identified Oswald, he identified him as a man
that he had seen before doing what&mdash;did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, I just asked him if he saw the man there that he picked
up, and he said it was the No. 2 man.</p>

<p>I don't know whether you've talked to him or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. But to me, he is the type of person that the longer you talk
to him&mdash;he just goes and he will try, to me, he will try to say, "Well, I'm
sure it was," but then he would go on with something else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, what I want to know is this&mdash;he identified Oswald, but did
he tell you where he had seen Oswald before and what Oswald had done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, just like that affidavit there, he says he thought he picked
him up down there close to the Book Depository on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you that? As he went out on Marsalis that some man
on the bus had grinned at a woman when the woman mentioned that the
President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't know exactly for word to word&mdash;it's in the affidavit
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is the story he told you that's in the affidavit; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir; after he gave me the affidavit and we were walking
back across the street to the bus, he said. "Well, I think he went out on Marsalis
with me." He said, "He could have got off sooner."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, I want to read this affidavit into the record. It says:</p>

<p>"The State of Texas, County of Dallas</p>

<p>"Before me, Patsy Collins, a Notary Public in and for said County, State
of Texas, on this day personally appeared Cecil J. McWatters, 2523 Blyth,
DA 1-2999, Dallas, Texas, Business Address: Dallas Transit Company.</p>

<p>"Who, after being by me duly sworn on oath deposes and says: Today, November
22, 1963, about 12:40 p.m. I was driving Marsalis Bus No. 1213. I
picked up a man on the lower end of town on Elm around Houston. I went on
out Marsalis and picked up a woman. I asked her if she knew the President
had been shot and she thought I was kidding. I told her if she did not believe
me to ask the man behind her that he had told me the President was shot
in the temple. This man was grinning and never did say anything. The
woman said that it was not a grinning matter. I don't remember where I
let this man off. This man looks like the #2 man I saw in a lineup tonight.
The transfer #004459 is a transfer from my bus with my punch mark."</p>

<p>Is that about what McWatters told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. That's what he told me when I was taking the affidavit from
him. Like I say, when I was walking back across the street with him to the
bus he said he wasn't for sure that he did ride down on Marsalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on this same night, did you show him this transfer No. 004459?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Issued by the Dallas Transit Co?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did he tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. He said it was definitely a transfer that he issued and showed
me his punch that he carried and he matched the punch on the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did Captain Fritz give you some rifle shells to deliver to
somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of the night or day was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall when it was, but, from his office there I took them
up to the crime lab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there three spent 6.5 rifle shells, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you return any shells to Captain Fritz?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All of them or one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No; he told me to bring him one back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You brought one back in an envelope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Lieutenant Day kept two; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you present when paraffin casts were made of Oswald's
hands and his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who made them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I believe that was Pete Barnes and Johnny Hicks, as well as
I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you attend another showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. That was about, oh, approximately an hour later after the
McWatters showup and there was a Mrs. Davis there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the same day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me, did somebody send you out to her house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes; Lieutenant Wells sent me out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was her first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, there were two of them&mdash;I don't recall for sure&mdash;as well
as I remember&mdash;it was Mrs. Jeanette Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There were two girls&mdash;Virginia and Jeanette?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Virginia and Jeanette Davis, and I took the affidavit from Virginia,
as well as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went from the police department out to the Oak Cliff region
someplace, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. 400 East 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who sent you out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Lieutenant Wells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who went with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. C.&nbsp;W. Brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what address did you go to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. 400 East 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did you see there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, there were quite a few people in the house there, but we
were told to contact Virginia Davis and her sister, Jeanette Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And, did you talk to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they give you anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Virginia gave me a .38 hull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did she tell you where she got it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I believe that she said that she found it in her front yard,
as well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. We carried them down to the police department and took affidavits
off of them and they went to the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. They identified Oswald as the No. 2 man in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was about what time of the night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. The lineup&mdash;I imagine was about 7:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 7:30 at night. And who was in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. They identified Oswald as the No. 2 man in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who else was in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't have that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No; I didn't hold the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you call that lineup, is that the number showup in your
report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't have a report showing any numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you with Virginia and Jeanette Davis, standing with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that was about what time of night, you said, 7:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your records show that on November 22, 1963, there was a showup
at 7:55 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, I don't recall exactly what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anyway, tell me how that showup was conducted, what did you
say to these people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, I was there with them and there at the time of the showup,
and they both <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I know&mdash;but how was it conducted&mdash;did somebody ask questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, as I recall, somebody was holding the showup and there
was other people there at the same time looking at them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did somebody ask questions of the men in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I think they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you show these two Davis girls a picture of anybody before
they went in there, did you ever show them Oswald's picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No; I didn't; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell them at the house, what did you tell them
before you brought them down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I just told them I wanted to take an affidavit off of them and
to take them down to a showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Down to a showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you were in the showup, did you say anything to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Did I say anything to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. During the showup, did you say anything to the two girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall saying anything to them at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. They said that the No. 2 man looked like the man, as well as
I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "Looked like the man"&mdash;looked like the man what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I believe she said that run across her yard, as well as I remember.
It's in the affidavit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who took the affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I took the one from Virginia, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who took the one from Jeanette?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I believe Brown took that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what did you do with the empty hull that was given to you,
that Virginia gave you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I gave it to Lieutenant Day in the crime lab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know whether or not Virginia or Jeanette Davis found
an empty shell&mdash;did she tell you she found an empty shell&mdash;Jeanette Davis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall&mdash;it seems like she told me she had found one
earlier and gave it to the police out there, as well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Gave it to the police that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here an affidavit signed "Mrs. Virginia Davis," is that a
copy of the affidavit that you took from Virginia that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. [Reads instrument referred to.] Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have this and the preceding affidavits marked as
Exhibits Nos.&mdash;Mr. McWatters' will be Dhority "Exhibit No. A," and Mrs. Davis'
affidavit will be "Exhibit No. B," of Mr. Dhority's deposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
(Instruments referred to marked by the reporter as Dhority "Exhibits Nos. A
and B," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you do anything more that day, Friday the 22d? You told us
you watched the preparation of the paraffin casts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there anything more you did that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall anything particularly. I did quite a bit of
telephone answering of the telephone there at the city hall&mdash;there was so much
going on at the city hall, I can't recall everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on the next day, November 23, you took part in a showup,
didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I didn't take part in the one on the cabdriver there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I was present&mdash;what it was&mdash;they wanted me to take the
cabdriver's&mdash;me and Brown, to take the cabdriver back down to the station,
and I believe we walked into the showup room while there was a showup&mdash;the
showup had just started or was going on and we walked in there and Mr.
Alexander from the district attorney's office was also there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a cab driver there named Scoggins [spelling]
S-c-o-g-g-i-n-s also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I believe there was&mdash;there was two cabdrivers there and I
know Mr. Alexander, down at the district attorney's office, told us they identified
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Whaley ever tell you he identified him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take an affidavit from Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, were you present at some time on the 24th when Oswald
was in Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be Sunday, November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us about what you did that day, on the 24th of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, on&mdash;I went up to jail along with Leavelle and Graves
and got him and brought him down to Captain Fritz' office that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present in Captain Fritz' office that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, Captain Fritz and Mr. Kelley and Mr. Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Sorrels of the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. And Mr. Holmes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Holmes is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Of the Post Office Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you bring him into Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. About 9:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you leave there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Oh, I imagine it was shortly after 11 o'clock when Captain
Fritz gave me the keys to his car and told me to go get it down there in front
of the jail office to move Oswald down to the County in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was said there in Fritz' office that day&mdash;do you remember
any of the conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. There was a lot of conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they talk about&mdash;the people in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, they were talking to Oswald and Mr. Kelley talked to
him and Mr. Sorrels talked to him&mdash;I don't think Mr. Holmes talked to him too
much. I think he recorded most of the interviews, as well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I couldn't remember all that was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make any notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was your deposition taken before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By Mr. Hubert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't know&mdash;it was some FBI man, as well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you weren't sworn under oath, just your statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes; I wasn't sworn under oath&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After they questioned Oswald, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, I believe we gave him a sweater to put on. I think it
was kind of cool&mdash;one of his sweaters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes; Leavelle handcuffed himself to Oswald just before I left
the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had he been handcuffed during the questioning in Fritz' office
that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall&mdash;I didn't have my handcuffs on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just before you left the office, Leavelle handcuffed him&mdash;did he
put one cuff on Oswald and one on Leavelle; is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fritz gave you instructions to do what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. He gave me the keys to his car and told me to go down and
get his car and back it up front of the jail door to put Oswald in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I went downstairs and got his car, unlocked his car, and was
in the process of backing it up there&mdash;in fact&mdash;I was just about ready to stop,
when Captain Fritz came out and Leavelle and Oswald and Graves and Johnson
and Montgomery came out the jail door.</p>

<p>Captain Fritz reached over to the door of the car and I was turned around
to see&mdash;backing it up&mdash;still had the car moving it along and I saw someone run
across the end of the car real rapid like. At first, I thought it was somebody
going to take a picture and then I saw a hand come out and I heard the shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Graves and Leavelle were there beside Oswald, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes; beside Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald was between Graves and Leavelle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Yes, I have one or two.</p>

<p>I would like to go back if I can to these lineups. You say you were present
at three of them and I have taken one by one&mdash;the first one was at 6:36 p.m. on
Friday, the one where Mr. McWatters identified Oswald. Did you at that time
observe the men who were lined up with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No; I didn't pay any attention to them, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you have any recollection of how their size and appearance compared
with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No; I didn't study it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And you don't remember what they were wearing either?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember anything unusual about Oswald's behavior at
that lineup, did he make a lot of noise, or did he behave just like at the other
three, as far as you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, do you remember how Mr. McWatters indicated his choice,
in other words, did he do it in such a way that the other people present could
hear who he was choosing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No; he did not&mdash;it was very low.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. He said it to you, but he said it quietly so that they couldn't hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. What about the other two people, did they indicate their choices
out loud, or did they also indicate them quietly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. It was also quietly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In other words, none of the men could hear what the other two
were saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, the lineup where Jeannette Davis made the identification, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
you observe anything about the appearance or clothing of the other men in that
lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember how Jeanette and Virginia Davis indicated their
choices to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Just standing there by them&mdash;very quietly told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. In more or less the same procedure as the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did Oswald do anything unusual at that lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall anything unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And the one Saturday morning with Mr. Whaley&mdash;I realize you
didn't participate in this one, but you were present. Do you not remember
anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I don't recall anything unusual about it at all&mdash;I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you remember whether at that one Oswald was yelling about
something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. It seems like that at that one he shook his hands up and made
some comment about being handcuffed. Of course, they were all handcuffed&mdash;it
was something like that&mdash;I can't recall for sure, but as far as any outburst or
anything like that, I don't recall anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Now, your report states that you were present in Captain Fritz'
office Friday evening when the paraffin casts were made. Could you estimate
from what time to what time you were in Fritz' office on Friday evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I sure don't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know about how long you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Was it just while they were having the paraffin tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Were you there for any of the interrogation of Friday evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. None at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Is it correct that you were at the police station until 2 a.m. on Saturday
morning, is that what time you went home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. That sounds about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Do you know what time Oswald was checked into the jail on Friday
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You had nothing to do with it, taking him up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. How would you characterize Oswald's behavior on Sunday morning
when you were present in Fritz' office? Was he at that time&mdash;did he seem
calm or excited?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Very calm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Did he seem fatigued to you, or did he seem to be about the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. He was very calm and fresh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Just one more thing I would like to cover and that is the conditions
in the police station surrounding Fritz' office, I mean, special with regard to
newspapermen being present&mdash;were the corridors filled with newspapermen&mdash;do
you recall how much of a crowd was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Well, let's say when you were there on Friday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. They were so thick you couldn't walk through them. You had
to shove your way through them to get in and out of the office. There wasn't
any in the office at all, but from the elevator to the office, cameras and lights
were set up so thick you just had to work your way through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. All right, Mr. Ball, I don't believe I have anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Dhority, this will be written up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. The only other thing that I had to do with that that we didn't
go into&mdash;now, I rode in the ambulance with Oswald to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, I held his pulse all the way out there. It was very, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
weak all the way and as we was turning into the hospital, the only time he
showed any signs of life and he started a muscle reaction <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was unconscious, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. He was unconscious all the time, and when he went into the
operating room, Detective Graves went in with him there and Captain Fritz
left and told me to arrange for the security of Oswald in the hospital, and I was
talking to Mr. Price, who is the administrator of the hospital, and we were
looking over a wing, when we got word that he was dead, so I went back then
and contacted Captain Fritz by 'phone and then got Oswald's clothing and had
Oswald's mother and wife look at Oswald's body and then carried him to the
morgue where I got Dr. Rose to photograph him with color pictures before he
did the autopsy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this will all be written up and it will be submitted to you
if you wish, and you can read it over and correct it and sign it if you want to,
or you have the option to waive your signature, and in which event this young
lady will write it up and send it on to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dhority</span>. Well, I will just waive my signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Fine. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t158">TESTIMONY OF RICHARD M. SIMS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Richard M. Sims was taken at 10:20 a.m., on April 6, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball, John Hart Ely, and Samuel A.
Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr. Alfred Goldberg,
historian, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you stand up and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Richard M. Sims.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your business or occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Police department, city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your position with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Detective in the homicide and robbery bureau since August 2, 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you tell me something about yourself, where you were born
and educated and what you have done before you went with the police
department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I was born and raised here in Dallas and I went to school&mdash;grade
school in Dallas, but moved out to a little city called Hutchins, south of Dallas,
and finished my education out there, and joined the Navy when I was 17, and
was discharged when I was 21, and I came to work down here when I was 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have been with them ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have been with homicide how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Since September 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, what were your hours of duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, actually, my hours of duty were from 4 to midnight, but
because the President was going to be in Dallas, I came to work early because
we was assigned with Captain Fritz to be down at the Trade Mart when the
President arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to the Trade Mart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It was around 10 o'clock, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; 10 a.m.&mdash;Captain Fritz and Boyd and I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you heard the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We were at the President's table. Chief Stevenson called Captain
Fritz over and told him the President had been involved in an accident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was about what time of day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. That was about 12:40, I believe, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Chief Stevenson told us to go to the hospital. Parkland Hospital,
so we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whom did you go with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Captain Fritz and Boyd and I, and I drove.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Captain Fritz is the head of homicide squadron, isn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Boyd is your partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; Boyd is my partner since 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do over there when you got to Parkland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we arrived at Parkland and we saw that Chief Curry was
there in front of the hospital, so he directed us back to the Depository Store,
down to the Book Store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me this&mdash;what did he say&mdash;what did he tell you to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember the exact words, but he told us to go back to
the store at the triple underpass&mdash;I don't remember what it was&mdash;I couldn't
say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody tell you at that time that there had been anyone in
the Texas Depository Book Building that had done the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I think at that time it was strictly speculation from
where the shot had been fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He just told you to go back to the scene of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes&mdash;as I said, I couldn't say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go back there&mdash;back to Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; we went directly to the Book Store and Sheriff Bill
Decker rode back with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went right to the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; and pulled up in front of it there&mdash;in front of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the way back, did you hear anything over the radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; we heard them mention the Book Store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they say&mdash;what did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, now, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard something about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; we went there for some reason&mdash;I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it something you heard over the radio that directed you to
go there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We went directly to the store and parked there in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we took our rifles out of the car and shotgun, and proceeded
to the building, went in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What door of the building did you go in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Captain Fritz and Boyd and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you tell me about what time you got to the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I got it here&mdash;about 12:58&mdash;about 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The radio log of that day at 12:36 shows that the following was
broadcast from the police radio log: "The witness says shots came from the
fifth floor of the Texas Book Depository Store at Houston and Elm. I have
him with me now and we are sealing off the building."</p>

<p>Do you think you heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I wouldn't have heard that. We didn't hear about the
shooting until 12:40, but we had to have heard something or we wouldn't have
went directly to the Book Store like we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 12:45, there was a broadcast that stated: "All the information
we have received indicates it did come from the fifth floor of that building."</p>

<p>"Which building?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
"The Texas Depository Building at Elm and Houston."</p>

<p>Do you know whether you could have heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, our radio was on&mdash;I could have heard, that; yes, sir. We
got to the hospital, I guess, about that time and we did have our radio on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went in the front door, who was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Captain Fritz, Boyd, and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We went directly to the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The main passenger elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was a freight elevator, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I think the passenger elevator goes to about the third floor
and then the freight elevator takes over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went up in the passenger elevator in the front of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went as far as it could go, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Then, we caught the freight elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be in another part of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; I think it's on the north end of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did somebody direct you where to go to get the freight elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe&mdash;I'm not positive whether they did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we got off on the third floor and there were officers there,
so we went all the way up and we started to the seventh floor, actually, and
there was officers on every floor as we went up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we stopped at the second floor, first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, were you on the elevator at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir&mdash;it was full of officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who some of the officers were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; I don't know which ones I can remember, but Lieutenant
Revill was there, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 2:35, you mentioned two officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Lieutenant Revill and Detective Westphal was over there with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are they with homicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; they are with the special service bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the special service bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, it's a combination of vice, narcotics, and undercover work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you got, you said, up to the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, let's see, we got off&mdash;we stopped at the second floor and went
to the third floor and some officer there had a key to a room and we made a
hurried search of it and there was a bunch of officers on that floor and we went
on to the fourth floor, and I don't know if we got off at the fourth or not, but
anyway, we got off at the seventh floor&mdash;each floor as we passed would have
officers on it, and we hadn't been on the seventh floor very long&mdash;for just a
while&mdash;until someone hollered that they had found the hulls on the sixth
floor, so we went back to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Someone on the seventh floor told you they had found the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; someone hollered from the sixth floor that the hulls had
been found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you could hear them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; you could hear them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down the stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; we went back down the elevator, as well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go when you got off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We may have had to climb the stairs from six to seven&mdash;I don't
remember how high that elevator goes. I know we went back to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go when you got off at the sixth floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We went over to the corner window there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It would be the one on Houston and Elm, that corner there&mdash;it
would be the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We saw the boxes stacked up about&mdash;I don't know&mdash;three or four
stacks high and found three empty hulls laying there next to the wall of the
Elm Street side of the building, the front of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was there when you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, there was two or three officers was there when we got there,
and I believe the officer that found them was still there. I have his name here
someplace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he a deputy sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, he was a deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who else&mdash;Luke Mooney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes&mdash;there was two or three officers there besides us&mdash;I don't know
who all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did Luke tell you whether or not he had moved the hulls or
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He said he had left them like he had found them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take a picture of those hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Lieutenant Day did, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he there right at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; he didn't get there until a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the picture taken of the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw Day take the pictures, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was the cameraman, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, there was another one there too. Actually, it was Detective
Studebaker that works for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Studebaker and Day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe it was Studebaker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they both have cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if they both had cameras or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw one of them at least take a picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; I know pictures was being taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When the picture was taken, were the hulls in the same position
as when you had first seen them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else did you see that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, someone then hollered&mdash;we started a search of the sixth
floor then, going from east to west&mdash;all the officers, and someone had found
the rifle over by the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be in what corner of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. That would be in actually the northwest corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Then, we went over to where the rifle was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; I saw the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It was laying there near a stairway, partially covered by some paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any pictures taken of that? Of the rifle at that location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who took that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, it was either Studebaker or Lieutenant Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who saw the picture taken&mdash;did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Then we finished there and went&mdash;started to go to the city hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said you finished there, did you see anything of significance
there besides these hulls and the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see a paper bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we saw some wrappings&mdash;a brown wrapping there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It was there by the hulls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it right there near the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. As well as I remember&mdash;of course, I didn't pay too much attention
at that time, but it was, I believe, by the east side of where the boxes were piled
up&mdash;that would be a guess&mdash;I believe that's where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the east side of where the boxes were&mdash;would that be the east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; it was right near the stack of boxes there. I know there
was some loose paper there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Johnson there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; when the wrapper was found Captain Fritz stationed
Johnson and Montgomery to observe the scene there where the hulls were found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was Marvin Johnson and L.&nbsp;D. Montgomery who stayed by
the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; they did. I was going back and forth, from the wrapper
to the hulls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the window open in the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any boxes near the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; there was enough room for someone to stand between the
boxes and the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any boxes anywhere near the window ledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; there was, I believe, I'm not positive about this, a couple of
boxes, one stacked on the other right at the left of the window and then there
was a stack of boxes directly behind the window about 3 or 4 feet high, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody take a picture of the boxes in the window&mdash;what
position they were on the window ledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, Lieutenant Day took a picture of all the surrounding area
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long were you on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, sir; let's see&mdash;at the time the hulls were found, I think the
hulls were found about 1:15, so we were down there just a minute or two. Let's
see&mdash;we got back to the city hall at 2:15 and we went over and talked to Sheriff
Decker 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you left, you say that Captain Fritz told Johnson and
Montgomery to stay near the place where the hulls were located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that after the picture had been taken of the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe it was during&mdash;before Lieutenant Day got up there, I
believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was after that that you went to the place where the rifle was
found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then did you go back to the place where the hulls were located on
the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's when the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; he was making pictures during that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who picked up the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I assisted Lieutenant Day in picking the hulls up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There were three hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what kind of a receptacle did you put them in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He had an envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he take charge of the hulls there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he take them in his possession, I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if he took them in his possession then or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you helped him pick them up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I picked them up from the floor and he had an envelope there and
he held the envelope open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't take them in your possession, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When the rifle was found, were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; we we still on the sixth floor where the hulls were, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anyone pick the rifle up off the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I believe Lieutenant Day&mdash;he dusted the rifle there for
fingerprints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you see Fritz do anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; he took it and ejected a live round of ammunition out of
the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who took possession of that live round?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you left the building about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we arrived at the city hall around 2 o'clock&mdash;I'll have to look
at the record&mdash;on this&mdash;about 2:15&mdash;we left there evidently about 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Captain Fritz and Boyd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Captain Fritz went over and talked to Sheriff Decker. He sent
word he wanted to talk to Captain Fritz, so we talked to the sheriff and then we
went to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was Decker when he said he wanted to talk to Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I didn't go inside the sheriff's office&mdash;I stayed out in the
corridor there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The sheriff's office is just a half a block from the Texas School
Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; it's across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the city hall where your office, the police offices are located,
is how far from the corner of Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, that's the 500 block there and the city hall is, let's see, in the
2000 block, I believe, so it would be 15 blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A couple of miles&mdash;a mile and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went back to your offices, was Fritz there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; he went back with Boyd and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you left Decker's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He went back with Boyd and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened when you went back to your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, sir; we got to the office and, of course, it was full of people
and I <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say it was full of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the floor was full of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Our office was&mdash;I don't remember about the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Officers&mdash;police officers, I don't know who all was up there, all I
know is that there was a lot of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had the press moved in and the television cameras at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember what time they had moved in&mdash;I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what happened when you got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, sir, I think he talked to a detective then&mdash;he's a lieutenant
now&mdash;Captain Fritz talked to Baker and said, "While we was up in the Book
Depository Store we heard Officer Tippit had been shot," and so Baker, I
believe, told Captain Fritz that they had the man that had shot Officer Tippit,
in the interrogation room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was that Baker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He was a detective then, but he's a lieutenant now. He has been
in the office there for several years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Baker told Fritz that Tippit had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; that we had heard that on the sixth floor of the Book
Store, but he told Captain Fritz that the man that shot Officer Tippit was
there in the interrogation room, or something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I don't know, let's see, we took Oswald at 2:20, Boyd and I,
took Oswald from the interrogation room to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and Boyd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 2:20 took Oswald&mdash;that's the first time you saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; that's right, he was there in that interrogation room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was in Fritz' office at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, let's see, during the interrogation, there was Mr. Bookhout,
that's Jim Bookhout, and Mr. Hosty, and Boyd and I and Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make notes of what was said at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did your partner, Boyd, make notes, do you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know if he did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have anything from which you can refresh your memory
as to what was said in that interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have some memory of what was said, don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, not the exact wording or the exact questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Give us your memory of the substance of what was said there at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I couldn't say that. I know that it consisted of his name
and where he lived and things of that nature, and where he worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, tell us all you can remember, even though it is not complete,
just tell us as much as you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember&mdash;I know, like I say, he asked him his name and
where he worked and things of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ask him whether or not he had killed Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He said, "No."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ask him if he had shot the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember now what&mdash;I wouldn't want to say for sure
what questions he did ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did the questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anyone else ask him questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I don't know if they did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask him any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Not at this time here, I didn't but I talked to him later on that
evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you didn't ask him any questions at the time you were there
then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I never did actually do any interrogation myself then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he handcuffed at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if he was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wasn't he handcuffed with his handcuffs behind his back, and
didn't he ask to be more comfortable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember any incident where Oswald said he would be
more comfortable if he could get his hands from behind his back, or something
of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember changing his handcuffs at any time so that he
could put his hands in front of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Of course, when he took the paraffin cast of his hands, he wasn't
handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But that was late that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; it was around&mdash;it was after dark, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I'm talking about&mdash;only about the interrogation that commenced
about 2:20 in the afternoon of November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I just don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember changing the handcuffs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long was he in Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, let's see, we first went in there at 2 and we stayed in there
evidently&mdash;this says here that the Secret Service and the FBI took part in the
interrogation of Oswald with Captain Fritz, and we took him down to the first
showup at 4:05.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, would you say he was in Captain Fritz' office from about 2:20
until 4 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he had to be either in Captain Fritz' office or the interrogation
room&mdash;that's the only two places that he was kept.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, do you have any memory of how long he was in Captain
Fritz' office the first time for the interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't recall if he stayed in there from 2:20 until showup
time at 4:05 or not. He may have stayed in there all that time or he may have
been put back in the interrogation room, which is right next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is the interrogation room from Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It's in the same office, but just a different room&mdash;there's just a
hall separating them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in the interrogation room, were you with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and Boyd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he was in the interrogation room for the first showup, did
you ask him any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; we talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what you said to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't remember&mdash;it was just&mdash;I know I asked him
about his&mdash;later on I asked him about his life in Russia and about him being
in the service and things of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask him that at this time? Before the first showup at
4:05?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was sometime then that you asked him about his life in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you able to tell us about what time that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I sure don't know what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could it have been after he had been in Captain Fritz' office and
and before the first showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It was after he had been in Captain Fritz' office; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was in the interrogation room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I&mdash;well, I don't know&mdash;I have talked to him both places, and I
don't know&mdash;I know he wouldn't talk at all about the assassination of the
President or of Officer Tippit, but he would talk about his life in Russia and
some things over here and about his family and things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you say he wouldn't talk about the assassination of the
President, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he would just deny knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you say he wouldn't talk about Officer Tippit's death, what do
you mean by that; what would he say, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he would make some remark and he just wouldn't talk about
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did he ever deny that he had anything to do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever make any admission to you that he had any knowledge
of Officer Tippit's death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Not at all; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever make any admission to you that he had any knowledge
of the shooting of the President at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. None at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he did talk to you about his life in Russia, what did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I would ask him where he lived and he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I've forgotten the name of the town he said he lived in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oh, in Russia&mdash;I see&mdash;what did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, it was some town I didn't know about it, but he did say he
lived in Moscow, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he said he worked in a factory and he liked everything over
there except the weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember anything else he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, no, sir; we talked about&mdash;just a general discussion about the
cars over there and the appliances, and just talked to him about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you about his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember what he said about his wife&mdash;he wouldn't talk
about her much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or his children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He said he had some children; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything else except he had some children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe he said he had&mdash;I don't know if he told me he had a brother
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was one time there that you learned that he had a room at
1026 North Beckley&mdash;when did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know when that was, now, that was found out that first
day, I believe. Another officer went out and searched his room and also went
to Irving, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The officers went out and searched the room sometime that afternoon,
around 3:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. That's right, I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me whether or not you are the one that found out
he had a room at 1026 North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Did he tell you that his wife lived in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if he told me that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the first showup was at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. At 4:05.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you conduct that showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we took Oswald down with us with the two police officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What two police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Clark and Perry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you took him down&mdash;where was he when you took him
down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He was in our office, Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be on the second floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the third floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you take him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we walked out of our door and turned left, and you go a few
feet and go to the elevator&mdash;where the waiting room for the elevator is&mdash;it's a
locked door, and then go from there to the basement of the city hall and then
go from the elevator there to the holdover room next to the stage, the showup
stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have a special place for showups, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And would you describe it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; in front of it is the detail room, where the officers get
their assignments every day before they go out in the squads, and the platform
is a raised platform&mdash;I guess it's 2 or 2½ or 3 feet raised above the floor and it
has got a black&mdash;some type of a cloth screen with floodlights at the top and down
at the bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it a cloth screen between <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Between the suspects and the witnesses we have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The stage and the outer part of the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are there seats in the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of seats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. They are just a regular chair&mdash;with a long desk, something like
this here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you took Oswald down with a couple of the officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; two of the officers went with us&mdash;Perry and Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And they are Dallas Police Department officers, are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And why did you have to have them come down with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know why they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who instructed them to go with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know that. I know they said they were there for the
showup so we went with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. During the showup, were they part of the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; they participated in the showup; they were with Oswald and
this jailer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How were they dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe one of them pulled his coat off, and I don't know how
they were dressed, but one of them pulled his coat off&mdash;I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were handcuffed together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; all of them was handcuffed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, there were four of them altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. They were&mdash;well, it would be Clark and Perry and Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Give their full names, if you will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what their position is with the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No. 1 was Bill Perry, W.&nbsp;E. Perry, he was No. 1, with the Dallas
Police Department, and No. 2 was Lee Harvey Oswald, and No. 3 was R.&nbsp;L.
Clark with the Dallas Police Department, and No. 4 was Don Ables, who is a
civilian jail clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who selected Don Ables to be in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know who selected him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does he have his office in the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, yes, sir; the jail office&mdash;he works in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you give me just a general description of what these fellows
look like?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; W.&nbsp;E. Perry, he is 34 years of age, 5'10 1/2" and about
170, I believe and that's a guess, now. He has brown hair, blue eyes, and dark
complexion. Richard L. Clark is 31, 5'9 3/4", 170, has blond hair, blue eyes,
and ruddy complexion.</p>

<p>Now, these weights could be different now&mdash;I don't know. Don Ables is 26,
5'9", 165, and brown hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of complexion does Don Ables have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't have that here&mdash;I believe he's just ruddy complexion,
I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in the showup, where were you, on the stage or in the
audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I was on the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you hear anything that was said from the audience part
of the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, someone was asking each one in the showup a few questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who that was that asked the questions in the first
showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I'm not positive, but I believe it was Detective Leavelle in our
office conducted the first showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what questions did they ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I couldn't say the exact questions, but as a rule, his age and
address and where he went to school and where he was born and just a few
questions like that, just to have them say a few words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Leavelle ask all of the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He asked all four of the men in the showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did Oswald act at this showup; tell me what he did and what
he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he just acted more or less like the other&mdash;acted natural.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Answered the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he protest any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say that he had a T-shirt on and no one else had a T-shirt
on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; now, I think the showup that I didn't conduct the next
day, I believe he refused to answer questions or said something about a T-shirt
or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't say anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; he acted normal, with the other showups I was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He answered the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anything else from the audience side of the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the names of any witnesses that were out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't know who was out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to any of the witnesses that were out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Either before or after the showup, did you talk to any of the witnesses
out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't believe I did&mdash;I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take any statements from any of the witnesses in this
showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After this showup, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We brought Oswald back to the office there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To the interrogation room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; back to Captain Fritz' office at 4:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 4:20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present in Captain Fritz' office at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The FBI agents and Secret Service agents talked to Oswald
some more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't record the names of the Secret Service officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you remember how long this interrogation of Oswald took
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, sir, we took him back to the second showup at 6:20, so that
would be a matter of 2 hours. Now, whether he was in Captain Fritz' office all
this time or in the interrogation room some of the time or Captain Fritz' office
all the time, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, at this second interrogation at Captain Fritz' office beginning
at 4:20, was Oswald handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, now, I can't tell you&mdash;I don't remember if he were handcuffed
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make any notes of what was said at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I never did make any notes of any of the interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember anything that was said at 4:20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any memory at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you make any kind of an attempt to testify to what you
heard there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I couldn't say for sure what was said or what he told
Captain Fritz or the agents either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; the only time I would talk to him would be when Captain
Fritz would be out of the office and then Boyd and I, or whoever was in the
office with him would talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But at this time when the Secret Service and the FBI were in
Captain Fritz' office, did you ask any questions at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anyone&mdash;any Secret Service man or any FBI man ask him
questions at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; they asked him questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know those men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I know a good many of them here&mdash;I didn't have their
names&mdash;I don't remember who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember who was in there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, at 6:20 there was another showup, was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where was Oswald before you took him to that showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He would be there in Captain Fritz' office there in the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you took him where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Back down to the same stage&mdash;on the stage there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was in this second showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The same officers and the jail clerk that was with him on the
first one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mention their names again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. All right, the second showup was at 6:20, approximately, and
there was W.&nbsp;E. Perry, police officer, Richard Clark, police department, and
Don Ables, jail civilian clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were these men handcuffed at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; they were handcuffed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they dressed the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe so; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they dressed differently than Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; I know they didn't have the color of clothes on or things
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they have ties on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't recall if they did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald had a T-shirt on, didn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He had on a brown shirt, some kind of a brown shirt, and he had
a white T-shirt on underneath that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Underneath that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; underneath that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. His clothes were rougher looking than the other men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I don't imagine that he would be dressed as nice as the
officers were, as far as their clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, the other three men that were in the showup, did they have
coats on&mdash;did anyone have a coat on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I don't believe&mdash;Mr. Ables&mdash;I'm pretty sure he didn't have
a coat on and don't believe any of the officers had them on&mdash;I don't remember
how they was dressed as far as their coats go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember whether or not they had ties on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who conducted the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, the second showup, I'm not positive, but I believe I conducted
the second showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you conduct it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, they are all under a number and I would have them&mdash;one,
two, three, and four, and No. 1 stand on that center back square there and
give their names and age and address and if they own a car, where they went
to school, where they were born, where they were raised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know who was out in the audience with the witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the names of any of the witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear any conversation that came from the audience side
of the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. None that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you give us in your first showup the numbers assigned
to these people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I'm sure I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, I wasn't sure you did, but give us the numbers assigned
to the second showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The first showup at 4:05 was No. 1, Bill Perry, Lee Oswald, R.&nbsp;L.
Clark, and Don Ables.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the order&mdash;one, two, three, four?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; one, two, three, four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, give us the order of the second showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Numbered the same for the second showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Same men and same numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After that showup, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We went back to Captain Fritz' office, and let me see, at 6:37,
we left the showup and went back to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We stayed with Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in your report, you mentioned that a murder complaint was
signed by Fritz that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you present when that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Oswald present also?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was present when the murder complaint was signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did this take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. In Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, let me see&mdash;Justice of the Peace Dave Johnston, and Assistant
District Attorney Bill Alexander, and I don't know who else was there&mdash;I don't
know who else was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the judge there&mdash;the justice judge&mdash;the J.P., Dave Johnston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Bill Alexander and Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you? And Boyd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Oswald was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was anything said to Oswald about the signing of a murder
complaint?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was said, and who said it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember what was said&mdash;I know Judge Johnston talked
to him and Captain Fritz talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did Alexander talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe he did, but I'm not positive about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what Judge Johnston said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what Oswald said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anyone tell him that a murder complaint was being filed against
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe so; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For what murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. For Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what Oswald said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do with Oswald after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. At 7:40 we entered the third showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, at 7:30 an FBI agent came in, didn't he, according to your
records?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; at 7:30&mdash;we sat in the office with Oswald and Mr. Clements
of the FBI came in and interrogated Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and Boyd were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Clements ask him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember the questions he asked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear what Oswald said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; but I don't remember what the answers were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, when was the next showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. At 7:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who were the men in the third showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, the third showup was No. 1&mdash;a Richard Walker [spelling]
B-o-r-c-h-g-a-r-d-t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Borchgardt&mdash;what is his address; do you have that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't have his address. He was a city prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what he was charged with at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir&mdash;I have his arrest number and his I.D. number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then was he No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No. <span class="locked">1&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No. 2 was Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was three?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Ellis Carl Brazel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He was a city prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what he was charged with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know his address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what happened to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe he's in the penitentiary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Brazel is in the penitentiary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe so&mdash;I'm not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was No. 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No. 4 was Don Ables.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the jail clerk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember how these men were dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't, I don't remember how they were dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they have coats on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if they had coats on or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they all handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who conducted this showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember who actually had the suspects to talk or who
was out in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were on the stage side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Still on the stage side; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did someone from the audience side conduct the showup and
ask the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald answer the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he dressed differently than the other three at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he was dressed differently but I don't know&mdash;how differently
he was dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he have on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He still had on the same clothes he was arrested in, so far as I
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In all three showups he had on the same clothes you described
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is Commission No. 150, is that the shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; that's the color shirt he had on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then he had on a T-shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well&mdash;one that color&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in this showup, did you know any of the witnesses that were
in the audience side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I knew about them, but I didn't know who was out there&mdash;no,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever take a witness' statement from any of the witnesses
at either of the three showups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Never <span class="locked">did&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After that showup, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, we took him back up to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. 7:55.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was there at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Mr. Clements, and he continued his interrogation of Oswald for
about another half hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I probably was; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present besides you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I couldn't say&mdash;I know Boyd was and I was present, but I don't
know if he was in there all the time or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, during this time, or sometime during this period&mdash;sometime
between these three showups, you searched Oswald, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The first one; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that was what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It was 4:05, I believe, but I will have to check my record here and
see [checking his record referred to].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was after the second showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; the first one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After the first showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It was before the first showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was before the first showup&mdash;the 4:05?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that was after the first interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where were you when you first searched him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We was in the holdover, in other words, the showup room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you took Oswald down for the first showup and waited in the
room outside, the showup room, you searched him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; Boyd and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you find?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I found a bus transfer slip in his shirt pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, Boyd found some .38 cartridges in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know&mdash;I have it here&mdash;I believe it's five rounds of .38 caliber
pistol shells in his left front pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Left-front shirt pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; they were in his pants pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Left front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The transfer was in his shirt pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would that be on the left side, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know if he's got two pockets or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take a look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. (Examined Exhibit hereinafter referred to).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Commission Exhibit 150 is being exhibited for the witness'
examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he's got two pockets in here and let's see if I have it on here&mdash;what
pocket it was&mdash;I didn't say&mdash;I don't remember what pocket he had that in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I went back up to the office and I believe initialed it and placed it
in an envelope for identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did you turn it over to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; it was either in the lieutenant's desk or Captain Fritz' desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Lieutenant who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We have two in there&mdash;Lieutenant Wells and Lieutenant Bohart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what about the five rounds of live ammunition, what did you do
with those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It was also placed in the envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And turned over to whom&mdash;Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know who that was turned over to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to a busdriver named McWatters?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I remember a busdriver coming up there but I don't think
I talked with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever examine the transfer for the punchmark date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The busdriver did. He identified that as coming from his punch-card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I know, but I want to know about you&mdash;did you look at the
transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I looked at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look at the date and the time that it was punched on the
transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if I did or not. I'm sure I looked at it but I
don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say it was shown to a busdriver and he made some remarks
about it; were you there when it was shown to the busdriver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So, you are just telling me what some other officer told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I didn't see actually the busdriver, I don't believe, identify his
transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the officer that showed the transfer to the busdriver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any identification bracelet on Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; he had an identification bracelet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have that on at the time of the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever remove that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; when they were getting his paraffin cast on his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do with that identification bracelet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I placed it in the property room cardsheet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine that identification bracelet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did it have on it, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It had his name on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was it made out of? What material?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. It was, I guess, sterling silver. It was a regular G.I. identification
bracelet with a chain and then his nameplate across the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, we are up to the time after the last showup when Mr.
Clements interrogated Oswald for about half an hour; what happened after
the interrogation by Mr. Clements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. At 8:55 Detective Johnny Hicks and R.&nbsp;L. Studebaker of the
crime lab came to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Hicks fingerprinted Oswald and then Sgt. Pete Barnes came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Pete Barnes. He is working with the crime lab also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did Barnes do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he may have assisted in the fingerprinting&mdash;I don't know
for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is he a crime lab man also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir, and then shortly later, Capt. George Doughty came in,
he's in charge of the crime lab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He just stayed a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How do you spell his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. (spelling). D-o-u-g-h-t-y&mdash;George Doughty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did they make paraffin tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They made casts at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. (reading from instrument in his possession). "He and Barnes
made paraffin casts of both hands and also the right side of his face."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That "he and Barnes"&mdash;who is "he"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. That would be Johnny Hicks, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was Johnny Hicks and Lieutenant Barnes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; and Barnes is a sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Sergeant Barnes and Johnny Hicks made the paraffin casts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of both hands and what side of his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. And also the right side of his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of whose face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Oswald's face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you there when they were made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I was in the room&mdash;most of the time I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time were these paraffin casts made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We started the fingerprinting at 8:55, I believe, they lasted a good
long while&mdash;I don't know how long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time were the paraffin casts made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't have any idea&mdash;it was sometime after 8:55.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you give me an outside limit on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, sir, they started the fingerprinting at 8:55, I guess&mdash;that
would take&mdash;just a rough guess, 10 or 15 minutes to do that, and they had to
heat their wax first and make the preparations then for the paraffin tests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you say that the paraffin tests were made not later than
10 o'clock that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Not later than 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I couldn't say. I know that they were in the office there
all this time making these paraffin casts of his hands and his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, at 11:30 p.m., Barratt and I made out the arrest sheets on
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was Oswald then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He was there and he was still in the office there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make the arrest sheets out in front of him while he was
there in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know if he was present when we did it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But he was still in the interrogation room of Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; he was in one or the other; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who had charge of him when you made out the arrest sheets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know who that would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We made out the arrest sheets on Oswald and shortly afterwards
Chief Curry and Captain Fritz came into the office there, came back to the office,
and told us to take Oswald down out in front of the stage at the showup
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Because we were told to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that usual to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Is it usual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; it's unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Unusual to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't tell you why he did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do it for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Just for the press, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We&mdash;shortly before midnight&mdash;we took him down to the&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
call it&mdash;it's where the officers meet there, where the showup room is&mdash;the assembly
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And was he on the stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He was in front of the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And&mdash;in front of the stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he had&mdash;the room was full of newspapermen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did they do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I believe they had a little short interview there with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ask him questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He answered; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the television cameras in there also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And this was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, it would be about 12&mdash;we kept him in there about 5 minutes
and went to the jail office about 12:20, so that would have been about, I guess,
about 12:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me exactly what Chief Curry told you before you took him
down there&mdash;what were his exact instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't believe Chief Curry said anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Captain Fritz told you to take him down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We were told to take him down to the press&mdash;to the police assembly
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who gave you those specific orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I couldn't say who gave me those specific orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you think it was Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I just don't remember who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have stated in your notes that Chief Curry came to Fritz'
office and told you to take Oswald down in front of the stage at the showup
room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Let's see (reading from instrument in his possession) "* * * shortly
afterwards Chief Curry and Captain Fritz came to Captain Fritz' office and told
us to take Oswald down out in front of the stage at the showup room."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that look like it was Curry that told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know which one of them told us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did one of the two tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; evidently they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what else did they tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. (Reading from instrument in his hand.) "Chief Curry gave us instructions
not to let anyone touch Oswald, and if they attempted to do so, for
us to take him to jail immediately."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This was in connection with the press interview with Oswald,
wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what questions were asked Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ask him whether or not he had shot the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe that was asked&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He told them "no."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ask him if he had killed Tippit or shot Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if they did or not&mdash;it was just a bunch of them
hollering at him&mdash;that's all I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A bunch of them doing what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. A bunch of them hollering at him&mdash;talking to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they talking loud?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; it was pretty noisy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you took him back to the jail office at 12:20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; we took him back to the jail office at 12:20 a.m. on November
the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you turned him over to the jailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; we took him up to the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We turned him over to the jailers there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You turned him over to the jailers on the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the next day, did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, let's see, I arrived for work at 9:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when did you first see Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We checked at 10:25 a.m.&mdash;we checked&mdash;Boyd and I checked Lee
Harvey Oswald out of jail and brought him to Captain Fritz' office for
questioning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Let's see, Mr. Bookhout of the FBI and Robert Nash who is the
U.S. marshal, Mr. Kelley of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. And that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I believe it says here&mdash;"Boyd and Hall stayed in the
office during the interrogation."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You weren't in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know why you left&mdash;did you have something else to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't know if I was called out or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long did that interrogation take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We returned him back to the jail at 11:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Then, shortly afterward, myself and Boyd and Hall and Detective
C.&nbsp;N. Dhority, (spelling) D-h-o-r-i-t-y&mdash;we went to Oswald's room at 1026
North Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who told you to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We made another search of his room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean by "search"&mdash;did you have a search warrant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if we had a search warrant or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went in the house, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; we went in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to the owner, Mrs. Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; we talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. or Mrs.&mdash;which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe both of them was there; I'm not positive about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went into Oswald's room, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I think all we found in there was a paper clip or something of
that nature. I don't remember what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A paper clip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We didn't find anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take anything away with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; we took the paper clip and a rubber band or something&mdash;I
don't know what it was&mdash;it wasn't anything to speak of, I know, the room was
clean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you arrive and what time did you leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, shortly after 11:30 we left&mdash;we arrived at 11:59 and left at
12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the afternoon, did you work on this case? On the Oswald case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; I'm sure we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to any witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't talk to any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take any statements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was the next time you saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. At 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We brought him back to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who are "we"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Myself, M.&nbsp;G. Hall, and Detective L.&nbsp;C. Graves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was Boyd when you did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He wasn't with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you get Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. From the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took him to Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We returned him at&mdash;myself, Hall, and Graves&mdash;returned him at
7:15 to the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, were you in Captain Fritz' office during that interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No; I don't believe I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what you did after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't know what I did after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see Oswald again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I never did see him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you on duty on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I was off that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you heard of Oswald's death over the radio; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Over the television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You watched it over television, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you fellows have any suggestions for questions&mdash;you might go
ahead and ask him any questions if you have any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes; I have a few things I would like to ask him with reference
to this&mdash;I'm not sure that we identified his notes and I believe we ought to do
that.</p>

<p>You were reading from or referring to a memorandum that you made when,
Mr. Sims?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. In regards to the President's assassination and the killing of Officer
Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When did you make the memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know&mdash;it was shortly after the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Within 3 or 4 days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. The same week&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you made it with your partner, Officer Boyd, the two of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You worked it out together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Let the record show that this is a memorandum that appears as
Commission Document 81-B, at pages 234 through 240. Was this memorandum
made from notes that you noted at various times as the things occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Notes and memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. They were made from your notes and memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. From my notes and memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And those notes were destroyed when the memorandum was
prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Mr. Boyd may have his&mdash;I don't have mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You don't have your notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't have mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The memorandum quotes a number of times&mdash;a very specific figure&mdash;is
this because you had some record of these times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. We keep records of the time that things happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. To the nearest minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And that's why you can be so precise in your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The information you gave us a little earlier describing the two
police and the jail clerk that were in the first two lineups, your statement there
was based upon notes that you brought here with you; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. You mean their descriptions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes; their descriptions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I got the descriptions after I was notified to be over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you know these individuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; I know them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And these descriptions are accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I don't know about the weight. I got this off of their descriptions
we have up there in the ID bureau in the personnel file&mdash;that weight,
I believe, Perry's&mdash;I just guessed at the weight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you have the same descriptions available for the two city
prisoners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I have those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you tell us what those are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir. Richard Walter Borchgardt, he is 23 years of age, 5' 9",
161 pounds, blue eyes, blond hair, and ruddy complexion.</p>

<p>Ellis Carl Brazel [spelling] B-r-a-z-e-l, he's 22 years of age, 5' 10", 169 pounds.
Now, this weight could be one way or the other because this was at the time
that they were arrested when they got this description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This information was obtained from police records?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir. He has green eyes, blond hair, and ruddy complexion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As far as you now remember, does it accurately describe the two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I couldn't say. I know it was what we had in our identification
jacket&mdash;these are their descriptions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But you have no independent recollection now of their description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. At page 3 of your memorandum, in describing events at the School
Book Depository, the memorandum states, and this occurred just after Lieutenant
Day picked up the rifle and dusted it for fingerprints&mdash;the memorandum
states: "Some man then called Captain Fritz, and he walked over to where
the man was. This man gave Captain Fritz the name of Lee Harvey Oswald
and his home address in Irving, Tex."</p>

<p>Would you give me something more about that&mdash;how Oswald's name came up
and in what context the name was given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; this man, I believe, was some supervisor there at the store,
and he gave Captain Fritz Oswald's name and address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you know why he gave it to him? In what connection he gave
it to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I'm not positive about this, but I believe that Oswald was missing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. In other words, most of the employees returned back to their jobs
after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you know whether any other employees were missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But as far as you know, that was the only name mentioned?
Mentioned by the supervisor at the Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. As far as I know; yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, the search in which you participated of Oswald at 4:05
on Friday, just before the first showup&mdash;you have told us that either you or
Mr. Boyd found five live rounds of .38 caliber pistol shells, and a bus transfer
slip, and an identification bracelet, according to your memorandum&mdash;Oswald
took his ring off and gave it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you remember anything else that was found on Oswald at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't remember anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. A wallet or identification card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; that had been taken off of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That had been taken off of him upon his arrest at the time of
his arrest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I don't know when, but he didn't have it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you say anything to him at that time about the ownership
of these things, about the ownership of the pistol shells&mdash;cartridges&mdash;did you
comment on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he say anything about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; there was no comment at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Or on the bus transfer slip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; he was asked something about it&mdash;I don't remember what
I asked or what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Sims, what was your impression of Oswald during Friday
and Saturday, what kind of man did he seem to you&mdash;what was his demeanor
like, what impression did you get about him and the way he was conducting
himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he conducted himself, I believe, better than anyone I have
ever seen during interrogation. He was calm and wasn't nervous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. He knew what questions he wanted to answer and what questions
he didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He had the answers ready when you got through with the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he complain at any point about his treatment during the
course of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I asked him if he wanted a cigarette, and I asked him if he
wanted a drink of water or to go to the rest room and things of that nature,
and I don't believe he ever accepted any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But he was never complaining about his treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Oh, he complained two or three times&mdash;I don't know what it
was about&mdash;about not having a lawyer or something. He said he wanted a
lawyer, and things of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But not about his physical treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No; I believe he told us that&mdash;he was talking about his eye, and
he told us that he deserved to get hit in the eye&mdash;I believe he said he deserved
being hit in the eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Because the officer had a right to do that&mdash;I believe that's what
he told us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What about obtaining a lawyer, what did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He said he wanted to obtain a lawyer. He named some lawyer
up in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. He said that to you or to Captain Fritz in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I heard it&mdash;I don't know whether he said it to me&mdash;whether
he told it to Captain Fritz or he may have told it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was the response from the police officer in charge at any
time he mentioned getting a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know what it was. I believe he used the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he seem tired to you in the course of the interrogations? Or
showups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. By the time of your last contact with him, a little after 12
that night, was he still in possession of his&mdash;have all his wits about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you still describe him the way you did before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; he was still alert&mdash;quick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Calm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Could you describe the conditions in the corridor and other areas
around Captain Fritz' office and the room in which the interrogations were taking
place? During the day Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, of course, our office&mdash;Captain Fritz' office was crowded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. With officials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Official FBI, Secret Service, and Government officials and city
officials&mdash;Texas Rangers and State officials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was this making interrogation more difficult?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I don't know if it would or not. A number was in Captain
Fritz' office during the interrogation&mdash;I believe during all of the interrogations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were the interrogations conducted so that one person asked all
the questions, or were several people asking questions during the course of the
same interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Several people conducted the interrogation. Of course, there wasn't
two or three speaking at one time&mdash;one of them would speak to him and more
or less ask him questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How about the conditions outside the offices, in the corridor, as
to people who were not officials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, it was a problem getting through. It was crowded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Because of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Photographers and newsmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were there television cameras in the corridor at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you know when they were brought in, were you present when
they were installed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No; I don't know when they were installed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As I understand it, you had to bring Oswald through part of this
crowd of newspapermen to get him to the interrogation room, when you brought
him to and from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; the interrogation room was all in room 317, but when we
would have to go through the crowd would be to take him to a showup, and the
next day when we would bring him from the jail to Captain Fritz' office, it
would be a matter of 20 or 30 feet there in the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And in the course of those trips through the crowd, would people
try to ask him questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And tried to get him to make statements on the microphone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; they would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would he respond&mdash;do you recall&mdash;ever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Sometimes he would and sometimes he wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did this have any effect on him, did it seem to irritate him in any
way, or did he also take this calmly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I didn't notice anything different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. No noticeable difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you describe his demeanor on Saturday as being the same
as it was on Friday, was he still calm and in complete self-control?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I was not around him a lot Saturday, I don't believe, but he still
was calm and alert and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How about his demeanor at the press conference Friday night
when he was taken down to the showup room to meet the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he was&mdash;during the press interview&mdash;he was pretty snappy.
He made some quick answers&mdash;I don't know what all it involved&mdash;he denied
knowledge of the President's assassination, I believe, and he denied knowledge
of killing Officer Tippit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And he was snappy and arrogant and hostile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; a form of arrogance, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But was he harassed by this or was he still calm and in control?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, he had control of himself; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So that his snappiness was, would you say, his way of expressing
his feelings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I don't know&mdash;I don't know, but he was snappy at that time&mdash;at
that press interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That's all. Thank you.</p>

<p>That's all I have, Mr. Ball.</p>

<p>I believe Mr. Ely has a question or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. There's one thing maybe you can help us clear up now. You took&mdash;I'm
referring to late Friday night or let's say early Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. You took Oswald up to the jail office on the fourth floor&mdash;about
what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I took him up to the jail office approximately 12:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And is that the last time you saw him before going home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes; and we turned him over to the jailers up there on the fourth
floor at 12:23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. And about what time did you leave to go home for the night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I believe&mdash;I'm not positive about this, but I believe that night
Boyd and I worked later than the other officers did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Would you have any knowledge as to whether Oswald was checked
out of the jail again after 12:23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Not to my knowledge. He was checked out later on in the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. Right, but I'm speaking of now of sometime around 12:30 again&mdash;a
quarter of 1 or something like that&mdash;you wouldn't know anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't know about that, but I checked him out later on
that day. I don't know what time it was. I checked him out at 12:25 a.m.&mdash;I
believe that's 10:25 a.m. is when I checked him out on the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>. That's all I have, Mr. Ball.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have been attaching these as exhibits just for illustration, and
do you mind if we mark it and make it part of your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; that will be fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. That will be Exhibit A of this deposition.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Sims Exhibit A," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the written report you made to the police department of the
events of the investigation on Friday, November 22, and Saturday, November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; and the day of Oswald's murder on the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be written up by the shorthand reporter and you can
read it if you wish and make any changes you wish and sign it, or you can
waive your signature and we will send it on to the Commission as you have here
testified as she has taken it down.</p>

<p>Do you have any preference on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to waive your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fine. That will be all right. Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<h2 id="t182">TESTIMONY OF RICHARD M. SIMS RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of Richard M. Sims was taken at 10 a.m., on April 8, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are Detective Richard M. Sims?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Detective Sims, the day before yesterday you gave testimony
in front of or before Joseph A. Ball?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At that time the matter came up concerning cartridge case
hulls that were found on the southeast corner of the sixth floor of the
Texas School Book Depository Building on November 22, 1963. Do you remember
that he asked about those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Just for continuity of the record, would you tell us just how
you came to see those hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; Captain Fritz, Boyd, and I, my partner, were on the
seventh floor, and someone called us to the sixth floor and said the hulls had
been found.</p>

<p>So we took the freight elevator, I believe, or the stairs, and went to the sixth
floor. Went to the southeast corner and three hulls were laying there by
the window on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you pick up the hulls at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Waited for the arrival of Lieutenant Day with the crime lab to
take pictures of the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who came with Lieutenant Day, if you can
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir. I believe it was Studebaker. I am not positive about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you watch that area up until the time the pictures were
taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I didn't stay there all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After the pictures were taken, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I was over there, I believe, when they finished up with the pictures,
and I picked the three hulls up and laid them on what I believed to be
a box of books there near the window, and Lieutenant Day dusted them for
fingerprints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then when your testimony was taken, did you specifically remember
what you did with those hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I didn't remember who brought the hulls to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Since that time have you had an opportunity to refresh your
recollection as to what happened to the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I talked to Captain Fritz and E.&nbsp;L. Boyd, my partner,
and refreshed my memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was said, and what do you now say happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Captain Fritz told me to get the hulls after Lieutenant Day finished
with them and to take possession of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you take possession of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I placed them in an envelope and put them in my coat pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember which pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. When we got to the city hall, I gave them to Captain Fritz
in his office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what time that was, possibly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; they took my notes the other day. I couldn't say. Whenever
we arrived back at the city hall, they have what time that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what the occasion was of your going down
to the city hall there? Is that why you happened to go down to the city hall
that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; we were going to get started on Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you on your way down there to investigate whether or
not he had any record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I didn't know what he had at the time. I don't remember. I
was driving, and captain, we stopped at the sheriff's office for a few minutes,
and then went directly from there to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why were you going to get started on Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know. Captain Fritz said go to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell you that they were going to get started on Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No. He said go to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that is what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got to the city hall, did you go directly to Captain
Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got there, was anyone inside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. His office was full of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Lee Oswald one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No. He was, I believe, now in the interrogation room. I am not
positive. He wasn't in Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do with that envelope when you got to Captain Fritz'
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I laid it on his desk and told him there was the hulls, or either gave
it to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't remember which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now what caused you to remember now what you actually did with
the hulls? I mean, what refreshed your recollection as to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Talked to Captain Fritz, and I remember we was going over to
where the rifle, someone had found the rifle in the meantime, and we was walking
over to where the rifle was found, and he told me to be sure and get the hulls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Well, I went over to where the rifle was found, and went back later
to where the hulls were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were the hulls still in the location you left them for being dusted
for fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; they were still taking pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they still taking pictures, or dusting them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I hadn't picked them up. They were still, as far as I can remember,
taking pictures, because Captain Fritz left two officers to preserve the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got back, what did you do after they got through with
the pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. When he got through with the scenery I picked the hulls up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it then that he dusted them, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, did Captain Fritz tell you that this is what you did, or Boyd
tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, I remembered the other day when I testified I wasn't too sure
who brought them down, and then after I talked to Captain Fritz and Boyd, I
remembered definitely we were walking over to where the rifle was found, and
he told me to be sure and get the hulls, so I did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Captain Fritz tell you, or the other, Day, that you were the
one that brought the hulls, or did you independently remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I remembered putting them in my coat pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Detective Sims, just so that I can have a complete understanding
of the process by which you refreshed your recollection, you talked to
Captain Fritz about this after you testified here on Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say and what did you say, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I told him I couldn't remember for sure about who brought the hulls
up there to his office or what happened to the hulls, and then I talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. He said, "Well, remember I told you to get the hulls and bring
them to the office."</p>

<p>And I talked to Boyd, my partner, and he said that Captain Fritz had said
that, too, so I remembered exactly about where I was when he told me this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, Captain Fritz told you on Monday, that back on
November 22, he had told you to get the hulls? Is that what Captain Fritz told
you on this past Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, not the past Monday. Now this <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, today is Wednesday. Could it have been on Tuesday, or
Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know if it was yesterday or Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it either late Monday, April 6, or Tuesday, April 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That Captain Fritz told you that back on November 22, he had
told you to get the hulls and bring them down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you also discussed this with Detective Boyd either on April
6 or 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are nodding your head yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, after they told you this, what is the fact as to
whether you then do or do not independently remember actually putting these
shells in an envelope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I do, yes, sir; I remember putting them in an envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not you now independently remember
putting that envelope in your pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I do, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Captain Fritz tell you that he saw you put them in your
pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No; he didn't say anything about the envelope or pocket. I remember
he told me to be sure and get the hulls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Boyd, did he say anything about an envelope? Or
pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't believe he did, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what color envelope it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I believe it was a brown, something brown envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to a brown manilla envelope on top of the desk
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how big an envelope it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; I don't. We have two different sizes, and I don't remember
what size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember from whom you got the envelope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Lieutenant Day had it. When he goes to a scene, he has envelopes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Lieutenant Day or anyone else see you put that envelope in
your pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know if he saw me put the envelope in my pocket, but he
was there when I took possession of the hulls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; I am not sure, I don't know if the other crime lab officer
was present or not. That would be Studebaker, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were these hulls when you last saw them, or saw the
envelope in which they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. In Captain Fritz' office, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they just laying on his desk, or in his physical possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. In this envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the envelope on his desk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't remember if I actually gave them to him or put them there
on the desk in front of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But he was there when you left there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that is the last time you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not you ever initialed the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. I don't know if I initialed the hulls or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you would have initialed the hulls, what initials would you
have used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. As a rule, RMS.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. RMS?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; but I believe I initialed the hulls or the envelope that I
put them in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you have initialed the outside or the inside of the hull?
By that, do you understand what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; it all depends. I would initial the outside of the hulls,
I imagine, or put a mark directly inside of the hull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Either on the outside or directly inside the top part of the hull?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; the end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the end of the hull?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, the spent end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The spent end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of that might be relevant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; but I do definitely remember him telling me about be sure
and get the hulls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You definitely remember getting the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes, sir; sure do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you and I ever talked before you walked through the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As soon as you walked through the door, I had you raise your
right hand and you started testifying, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to read this deposition, or are you going to sign the
other deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. No, sir; just go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Ship it on in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sims</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, thank you, sir.</p>

<h2 id="t186">TESTIMONY OF RICHARD S. STOVALL</h2>

<p>The testimony of Richard S. Stovall was taken at 11 a.m., on April 3, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you please stand up, Mr. Stovall, and be sworn.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before this Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you please state your name for the record?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Richard S. Stovall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your address, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. 3211 Grayson Drive, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Detective with the Homicide Bureau, City Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Approximately 10 years&mdash;it will be 10 years this May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the Commission has asked us to ask every witness to tell us
about where he was born and his education and what he has done, because
they are unable to see you and they would like to know something about you.</p>

<p>Can you tell me that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, I was born here in Dallas in 1928. I was born in a frame
house over here on West Page&mdash;329 West Page. I went to grade school at
Winnetka Elementary School and I attended W.&nbsp;E. Greiner Junior High School
over here on South Edgefield. I went to high school at Sunset High out on
Jefferson Boulevard. After I left high school, I went to the Navy for 2 years,
which was just after World War II and I quit high school, by the way, and
after I got out of the Navy I came back to summer school Tech and finished.</p>

<p>After that, I went to work for the post office. After a few other jobs I had
been with for just a short period of time&mdash;I went to work at the post office and
I worked there for them for approximately 5 years, I believe; I think it was
from 1949 to 1954, and in 1954 I quit the post office and went to the Police
Department and I have been there since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are a detective, are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You work in plain clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been in this particular department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I have been in this department since approximately August 15,
1962&mdash;about 18 months, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you call your department of the Detective Bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. It's Homicide-Robbery Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you work under Captain Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, had you been assigned a special duty, in
view of the President's visit to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; I had&mdash;after I got to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. It was around 2 o'clock&mdash;I was watching television that morning
and heard the deal on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were not on duty at the time the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to work at 2 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Well, I was scheduled to go to work at 4 that day, I believe,
but as soon as I heard that I got cleaned up and got ready for work and went
on in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you given an assignment as soon as you got down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; I wasn't&mdash;as soon as I got there.</p>

<p>I got there and one of my partners, G.&nbsp;F. Rose, got there about the same time.
We were talking to a witness that had seen all the people standing out there&mdash;he
didn't actually see anything, so we didn't even take an affidavit from him
because he didn't see anything.</p>

<p>While talking to him, the officers brought Lee Harvey Oswald into the
Homicide Bureau and put him into an interrogation room we have there at
the bureau. After we finished talking to this witness, we went back there and
talked to him briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what was said to him and what he said to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I don't recall exactly&mdash;I went in and asked him for his identification,
asked him who he was and he said his name was Lee Oswald, as well
as I remember. Rose and I were both in there at the time. He had his billfold
and in it he had the identification of "A. Hidell," which was on a selective
service card, as well as I remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's [spelling] H-i-d-e-l-l, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I'm not positive on that&mdash;I believe it was [spelling] H-i-d-e-l-l,
I'm not sure.</p>

<p>And he also had identification of Lee Harvey Oswald, and I believe that was
on a Social Security card and at that time Captain Fritz opened the door
to the office there and sent Rose and I to go out to this address in Irving at
2515 West Fifth Street in Irving.</p>

<p>That was&mdash;I don't know where the Captain got the address, but it was an
address where he was supposed to be staying part of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The captain had you get another man to go with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes; we got J.&nbsp;P. Adamcik to go with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is he a detective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes; he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you did that, did you, you drove out there to Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The three of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes; the three of us&mdash;we went out to the location and parked,
oh, a block or half block from the house. We were supposed to meet some
county officers out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why were you to meet the county officers out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Well, Irving is out of our jurisdiction, actually, we had to either
have the Irving police or the county officers with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would that be within the jurisdiction of the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you meet some county officers there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; they arrived about 30 to 45 minutes after we did&mdash;after
we got out there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you wait for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you wait for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. This was about one-half a block or a block from the house
address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you arranged to meet the county officers at this spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, yes, no, sir; we hadn't. We told them we were down the
street about half a block. Of course when they came out there they could see
us parked in the car down the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what county officers did you meet out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Well, there was Harry Weatherford and the other two&mdash;one
name was Oxford, and I don't recall the other one's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How about Walthers&mdash;does Buddy Walthers sound like it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was the third one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then after you met them, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. We went on down to them and drove up in front of the house
and parked and got out and walked up to the front door and Adamcik and
two of the officers went to the back and Rose and I went, and the other officers
went to the front door and we knocked on the door, we could see some people
inside the house and we could see through the front door, the door was open
and the television was playing and Ruth Paine came to the door and identified
herself to us. She said, "Yes; you are here about this mess that's on television."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell her about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. At that time we told her that we wanted to search the house.
We explained to her that we did not have a search warrant but if she wanted
us to get one we would, and she said, "That won't be necessary"&mdash;for us to come
right on in, so we went on in the house and started to search out the house,
and the part of the house that I searched was the front bedroom where Marina
Oswald was staying. There are quite a few items on the list of property I have&mdash;I
believe you have a copy of it. There are two that were taken out of that
bedroom there&mdash;a bunch of camera equipment, for one thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I want to go backward at the moment&mdash;have you identified
that property from your list, and can you tell me what was the division of labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
there between you officers when you were permitted to search the house, you
went into the bedroom; who went with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I don't believe there was anybody went with me at the time
I went in. I heard&mdash;I think Rose started to the back bedroom, which would
be Ruth Paine's bedroom and Ruth Paine was standing there talking to him&mdash;I
could hear her talking to him and she told him that Marina suggested that
he look out into the garage and so they looked and they were out of my sight
then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard Ruth say to Rose that Marina had suggested he look
in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear Ruth Paine tell him why Mariana had made that
suggestion&mdash;what her reasons for it were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So, you think that Rose went to the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Adamcik do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Well, Adamcik was out in the back. Now, before I went into
the bedroom, I went to the back door and opened it and Adamcik and the two
county officers came inside, but where Adamcik went, I couldn't tell you for
sure. I know that he looked through some of the stuff in what I would call
the den, which is adjoining the kitchen there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Ball and the Witness Stovall off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Getting back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Shortly after that, Rose came back in carrying this blanket,
as well as I remember, it was tied at one end and the other end was open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was tied with what kind of material?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. It was tied with a white cord, as well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A white what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. A white twine&mdash;it was thicker than a kite twine that you see
or use on kites&mdash;more like this they use for wrapping large packages and tying
them and he showed me that end, of course, he told <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. He told me that when he went to the garage, Marina had
pointed to the blanket there and she said something to Ruth Paine and Ruth
Paine told him that that was where Lee kept his rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the search that you made was in Marina's bedroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you have a list of the articles that were taken from
Marina's bedroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, I do. I've got a list of all the articles we took from the
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Give me that list first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. [Witness handed list to Counsel Ball.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This list was made up by you men on the site or after you got
back into the squad car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, this list was made the next day after we came back to
work. This stuff was all put in boxes and put in the trunk of the car and put
back in one of our interrogation rooms there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the next day you made a list of it, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, Rose and I and there were two FBI agents that went
over the property at the same time. We initialed the property, that is, we
went over it&mdash;this list here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This list here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, this list here is a list of the property taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A list of the property taken from Ruth Paine's home at 2515 West
Fifth Street, Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. That was on the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d at about 3:30 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. 3:30 or 4&mdash;somewhere in there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I'll go into that later, and this was the list that was made up by
you and Rose and two FBI agents the next day at the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I'd like to have this marked as "Stovall Exhibit A," and it consists
of page 1 and page 2 for the deposition.</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked as "Stovall Exhibit No. A," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. As well as I remember, Detective Senkel, S-e-n-k-e-l [spelling]
and Detective Potts were both there too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, look at Exhibits A-1 and A-2 for the purpose of refreshing
your memory, will you mark on that those items which you have found in
Marina's bedroom&mdash;do you think you remember those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. [Marked instruments referred to.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, after you check them, we will go over them and you can
make an explanation for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. All right, fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, since we have gone back on the record&mdash;Exhibit A-1 and
A-2 have been marked&mdash;have you marked those things which were taken from
Marina's room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have an explanation to make as to certain of those, haven't
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. On this list here&mdash;where it has 1963 Kodachrome transparent
slides, you have it coded at the top, I have one brown pasteboard box filled
with camera film slides. One of those, I believe, came out of the back room,
which would be Ruth Paine's bedroom, and the other came out of the chest
of drawers in Marina Oswald's bedroom, but I'm not sure which came from
which place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know where the other articles that were on that list that
have not been checked, were found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Some of them I do, and some of them I'm not positive on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you find them, or did some other officer find those other items&mdash;those
other articles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Well, it's hard to say. I don't remember for sure where these
came from. I know that I went through the front bedroom there and when we
started&mdash;I went to the back bedroom and looked at some of the stuff in there
and Rose was also in there and Adamcik came in there too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Give us, from your memory, then, the other articles that are not
checked there? Take a look at them, and then tell us, if you can, from your
memory, just where you found those articles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. There was one box of Kodaslides in the single name of Ruth
Hyde, another yellow box of Kodaslides, single&mdash;I'm not sure where they came
from. I believe they came out of Ruth Paine's bedroom. I have listed one
book from Sears Tower slide projector.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't make a check on it if you didn't find it in Marina's
bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; I missed one up there when we checked them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. That one, I'm not sure which bedroom it came from&mdash;I know
it came from one of the bedrooms, but I don't know which one. I've got listed
"one grey metal file box, which is 12 inches by 6 inches; youth pictures and
literature." I've got, "One black and gray metal box 10 inches by 4 inches,
letters, etc., one box brown Keystone projector." Let's stop just a minute and
let me tell you about this.</p>

<p>These two metal boxes came out of Ruth Paine's bedroom. This Keystone
projector came out of the closet in the hall. Then, I have listed, "Three brown
metal boxes 12 inches by 4 inches containing phonograph records." They came
out of Ruth Paine's bedroom.</p>

<p>I've got listed, "One Blue Check telephone index book (addresses)"&mdash;I'm not
sure which bedroom that came from. And, I've got listed "One bracket (instruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
for mounting)" and I believe that came out of Marina's bedroom&mdash;I'm
not sure. The next is not checked and I'm not sure, but it is "1963 Kodachrome
transparency slides," which I explained a while ago. The next one
I don't have checked is "One envelope with women's book entitled 'Simplicity'".
I'm not sure which bedroom that came out of. Then I've got "One Russian
book."</p>

<p>We took several books from Marina's bedroom and I don't recall taking any
books from Ruth Paine's bedroom, but I don't remember the particular ones&mdash;it's
very possible I did, I can't be sure, but that's the last one I don't have
checked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you search any other part of the house besides Marina's
bedroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I assisted in searching the back bedroom. I searched the hall
closet and I also looked at several things in the living room and the kitchen
and the den.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you search the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; not that day, I did the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Rose searched the garage that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; he was out in the garage. We were going over the
stuff pretty hastily at that time&mdash;that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long were you there that day&mdash;how long were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I would say for approximately 2 to 2½ hours, if that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you first went in, did Ruth Paine say anything to you
about expecting you, or something of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; when we first came to the door and knocked on the
door, she came to the door and she says, and we identified ourselves, she said
"I have been expecting you. You are here about this mess that's on television,"
and the "mess that's on television" at the time she was talking about was when
they were talking about the President's murder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Oswald had been apprehended at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, he had, but he had been apprehended before we got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you got there Oswald had been arrested and brought
into the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. They had brought him into the office after I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Later on, did her husband come in there&mdash;come in the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, I guess we had been there approximately 15 minutes when
Michael Paine came out and said he had taken off from work and he said he
heard about the President's murder on television and he thought he would
come right on out and see if he could be of any help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say whether or not he had heard about it on radio or television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; I don't recall him saying where he said he heard about
it&mdash;I don't recall him saying that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask him any questions at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; I can't recall asking him anything at that time. However,
I did talk to him but I don't remember what the conversation was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did a Mrs. Randle come in the house also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; she didn't. While we were loading this stuff into our
car and into the sheriff's deputy's car, we were on the outside, and you know,
going in and out, and she had stopped Adamcik and was talking to him and he
came over and talked to me and went on back and talked to her and she said
that her brother had taken Oswald to work that morning and she said that
she had seen him put some kind of a package in the back seat of her brother's
car. She told us it could have been a rifle&mdash;is what she said. She said it was
either in a brown paper box or wrapped in brown paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you leave there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. It must have been around 5:30, because it was&mdash;I believe it was
6 when we got back to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you bring somebody back with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we brought Michael Paine&mdash;he rode with the sheriff's deputies
and we brought Ruth Paine and Marina Oswald and Marina's two children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you take them into the offices of the police?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we did. We took them into the Homicide and Robbery
Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to them after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; not that day&mdash;I didn't. We took them from there into
the Forgery Bureau because there was so many people in our office up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Into which bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Into the Forgery Bureau&mdash;we took them from the Homicide
Bureau into the Forgery Bureau because they had room in there where we could
leave them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do the rest of that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. After that we went&mdash;we called on the phone&mdash;Rose did&mdash;trying
to find this Wesley Frazier, who was this Mrs. Randle's brother to talk to him
about this package that his sister said Oswald had put in his car that morning.
Rose checked around and finally located him at a clinic in Irving. He called
and found out where Wesley Frazier was&mdash;he called the Irving Police Department
and talked to Detective McCabe out there and told him what the situation
was and McCabe told us to call him back later and he would see if he couldn't
get ahold of him out there and so we called him back in 15 or 20 minutes, I
guess, and he said that he had the boy at the Police Department out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went out there and talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you also searched their home, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you brought Linnie Randle and Wesley Frazier into
Dallas and took statements from them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; we didn't take the affidavits from them, but I don't
recall who did, but after the affidavits were taken, we started back to Irving with
them, they also had a minister from their church with them, I believe. We
started back to Irving and we got about halfway, I guess, and they called us on
the radio to return to the station with the witnesses and we came back and
Rose called the captain from the basement phone down there and he said he
wanted to take Wesley Frazier up and run him on the polygraph, and he agreed
to this and so we took him up there, and we didn't have a man on the polygraph at
that time. I think he left around 9 o'clock and so we called him on the phone
and he came back down and got there around 11:15 or 11:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was about 12:10 when you ran the polygraph on Frazier,
wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; it was about 12:10 when we finished, I think, when he
finished running it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About 12:10 when you finished the polygraph on Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Then, we went back down to the basement. We had left Frazier's
sister and the minister down in the basement, as well as I remember. And we
took him back down there and then we went on back out to Irving and left
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you took the polygraph, you were present during the polygraph
examination of Frazier, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And during this examination, did you have before you the affidavit
which Frazier had made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did the questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. R.&nbsp;D. Lewis, he's the polygraph operator.</p>

<p>I might explain that to you&mdash;in our polygraph room we've got a two-way mirror
there and in another room behind it, so that the officer that is investigating
the case, if he wants to, can watch the examination being given, and you can
hear the questions and the answers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go home, then, after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; after we took them back to Irving we went home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The next day, you made another search of the Paine home, didn't
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Must have been around 1 o'clock, just past noon, 1:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you obtain a search warrant first this day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From what judge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. From J.&nbsp;B. Brown, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who went out on the search party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Detectives Moore, Rose, Adamcik and myself. We went by the
Irving Police Department and picked up Detective McCabe and he went with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Moore is also a detective attached to the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, Homicide Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that day you arrived at the Paine home about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I would judge roughly around 1:30 or 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you knock on the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we did, and Ruth Paine, I believe was the only one there
at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you say and what did she say to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. We told her that we returned, we wanted to, to make a further
search of the house and we showed her the search warrant at the time, and I
believe she said we didn't need that, to come on in and that we could search the
house anytime we wanted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you search the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we did. We mainly concentrated our search of the garage
this time, because the first search of the garage had been a rather quick one, and
not having been in the garage on the first search at all, and I know Rose hadn't
spent much time out there because he didn't have time to on the length of time
we spent at the house. So, we searched the garage and concentrated our search
there.</p>

<p>Ruth Paine came out into the garage and I told you Ruth Paine was the only
one there awhile ago&mdash;I remember Michael Paine was in the garage. I think
he came up after we got there&mdash;I'm not sure&mdash;it's possible that he got there
after we got there, but I don't recall, but both of them came out in this garage
and showed us the stuff that belonged to Lee Oswald and Marina Oswald and
showed us the stuff that belonged to them and they left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you mean they left you in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, they got in the car and drove off. They left their house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have made a report of what you did that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have that before you, Mr. Stovall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you refreshed your memory from the report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I glanced over this&mdash;I've read this first and I haven't read this
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to take some time to look over that report of your
search on the 23d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You stayed in the garage how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. It seems like we were in that garage about 1½ or 2 hours.
We might have been there longer than that. We made a thorough search of
the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there some reason you went out there the second time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. To the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, to the Paine home on the Irving Street address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; the main reason we went out there&mdash;we wanted to
make a more thorough search of the place. The first search that&mdash;we didn't
actually have time to stay as long as we needed to, to check the whole house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you given any specific instructions by anyone from your
department as to what to look for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you make a list of what you had found and took with you
on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is this the list?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where was that made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. That was made down at the city hall in the Homicide Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to mark this as "Stovall Exhibit B."</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked as "Stovall Exhibit B," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, at that time did you find any snapshots that appeared to be
Oswald in the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; Rose did, and when he looked at them, he said, "Look
at this." At the time he said that&mdash;he showed us the snapshots and the negatives
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they show you what appeared to be Oswald in the snapshots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had the negatives and snapshots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he showed Oswald&mdash;what was significant about the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. He was in a standing position just outside of the house holding
a rifle in one hand and he was wearing a pistol in a holster on his right hip and
he was holding two papers in the other hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take the snapshots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, we took the snapshots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the negatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where are they listed on this exhibit&mdash;this Exhibit B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I believe we listed them where we've got "Miscellaneous photographs
and maps." There were several other photographs that we took when
we were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were in the garage, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where were they in the garage that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. As well as I remember, they were in a brown cardboard box
about, I guess, 2 feet by a foot and a half or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was in the box with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. There were, as well as I remember, a few books in there and
letters and papers and photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you also found some bags, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; there were some seabags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. One of them was&mdash;I think both of them were a kind of an
Army color&mdash;olive drab, whatever you call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And suitcases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; there were some blue suitcases and I think a brown one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Made out of what kind of material?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. It appeared to be a leather material.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said there were three&mdash;you've mentioned blue and brown, is
there any other color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. There was, as well as I remember&mdash;one of the brown ones was
a leather appearing suitcase and the other was more of a&mdash;some kind of a
paper or cardboard suitcase, as well as I remember that thing. It was partially
torn, I mean, it had been well used and was coming apart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were there three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was the color of the third one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I believe it was brown also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Leather or paper or cardboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No; this was paper&mdash;it was some kind of a paper deal or
cardboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you also found a magazine advertisement from Klein's Department
Store, Klein's in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir; that was in the same box with the photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just for illustration of your testimony, I would like to have marked
as an exhibit to the deposition your report of the search of November 22, 1963,
as your Exhibit No. C, and your report of the search of November 23, 1963,
of the Paine residence as Exhibit No. D.</p>

<p>(Instruments referred to marked by the reporter as "Stovall Exhibits C and
D," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mention in there a map&mdash;what kind of map or maps did you
find there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I don't recall just what kind of maps they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you leave there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Must have been around 4:30 or 5, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Mrs. Paine or Mr. Paine say anything more to you than you
have already told us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; as well as I recall, Mr. and Mrs. Paine were both gone
from the house when we left there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took these materials with you that you have on this list?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took them down to where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. We took them down to our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you made a list of them that day, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you do anything else on this investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir; that's all I can recall that I did on the investigation.
I might add, there was&mdash;well, you have that on the list&mdash;some property.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. When we took this identification off of Lee Oswald that had this
selective service card, the name Hidell, and he also had his own identification&mdash;at
the time we were in the garage we found some negatives out there that
appeared that he had make a snapshot of a selective service card, and on the
back of the negatives it was where the name would have been typed in&mdash;there
was some stuff on the back of the negatives to block out the name when it was
reprinted, and there were some selective service cards that he had printed
himself out there from a negative that were blank and which appeared to be
the same that he had on him at the time, on the 22d of November, that had
the name of "A. Hidell" typed in on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you appear at any showups of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you at any of the interrogations of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, I think that's all, Mr. Stovall. Thank you very much for
coming over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. Okay, thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Thank you so much, Mr. Stovall, we appreciate your coming by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stovall</span>. I hope it was of some help to you.</p>

<h2 id="t195">TESTIMONY OF WALTER EUGENE POTTS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Walter Eugene Potts was taken at 11:45 a.m., on April 3, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you hold up your right hand and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
before the Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Walter Eugene Potts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What business or occupation are you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I am a detective with the police department, homicide, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been with the police department in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Since October 21, 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long have you been with the homicide department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. June 6, 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me something about where you were born and where
you were educated and what you have done since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I was born at Sherman, Tex., April 28, 1922, and I came to Dallas
in 1924 and was raised here in Dallas, attended public schools in Dallas, graduated
from this Dallas&mdash;it's Crozier Tech now, but it was Dallas Technical High
School right here on Bryan Street in 1941, and when I graduated I went to work
for Southwest Airmotive at Love Field, and I worked for Taycee Badgett Aviation
in 1942 and 1943, in Shreveport, La., and I took an aviation cadet mental
and physical down there and came back to Dallas to be inducted into the
service, and I worked for Lockheed at Love Field before I went in the service,
and I went in the service in July 1945. I was discharged in January 1947. I
was in the 796th Military Police Battalion in Vienna, Austria, and also the
505th there.</p>

<p>I came back and went to work for the Taylor Publishing Co. just before I went
to work for the police department. My mother and father, they still live here
out on Brookfield and my sister lives here. I am one of the very few native
boys in this police department down here&mdash;that's raised right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And on November 22, 1963, you had the day off, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir; that was my day off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you hear on the radio the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, my wife and I had gone to the cleaners up there at Jim
Miller and Military, and I suppose it was around 12:30 or a quarter to 1&mdash;around
1 o'clock and we pulled up in front of the cleaners there and Mr. Wright
at the barbershop came out to the car and he said, "Have you heard about the
President getting shot?"</p>

<p>You know, I thought he was joking and I thought he was kidding and I
turned on my car radio and there it was.</p>

<p>We went on back home and I called the office immediately and talked to
Detective Baker, he's a lieutenant now, and he said he was calling all the men
back and I started to get dressed&mdash;get ready, and I told him I would be there
as soon as I could, and I got dressed and got there within the hour, which was
around 2 or before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you first got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. When I was walking across the street there, I parked my car
over at the Scottish Rite parking lot there and it's the Masonic lot and when I
come across the street there at Commerce and Harwood this officer on the
corner there said, "Did you hear about Tippit getting killed?" I said, "No; I
didn't hear about that." He said, "Yes; I understand he got killed on a disturbance
call over in Oak Cliff." That's the first I had heard about Tippit
and when I got to the office, I walked in and Baker told me, "We have some
people here from the Texas School Book Depository&mdash;there are four or five
of them back there," and he said, "Would you go back there and take some
affidavits from them?" And I said, "Sure," and I went back there and took one
from this Arce, and I was in the process of taking one from this Jack
Dougherty when I heard some officers coming in the door there, and I heard
one of them say, "We've got the man that killed Tippit."</p>

<p>So, they brought him on back in while we were sitting back in the squadroom
and I was sitting back there with Dougherty and Arce, and they came by and
put him in the side interrogation room back there. As you walk in the door,
there is an interrogation room right straight ahead and then you turn right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
go back in the squadroom and you go on back in the squadroom, and this Mr.
Dougherty looked at me and he said, "I know that man."</p>

<p>He said, "He works down there in that building&mdash;the Texas School Book
Depository Building." He said, "I don't know his name, but I know him." So
did Arce&mdash;he said, "Yes, he works down there."</p>

<p>So, I went ahead and took those affidavits from them&mdash;from those people and
we got them notarized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean Arce and Dougherty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Arce and Dougherty. There were some more officers back there
taking affidavits from some of the others&mdash;some of those other people&mdash;I don't
know&mdash;you know, time and all the confusion around there, you don't exactly
know what time, but my partner, Bill Senkel, and F.&nbsp;M. Turner&mdash;we work a
three-man squad, and Bill came around and he talked to Captain Fritz, and he
said "Come on, let's go. We are going out to 1026 North Beckley."</p>

<p>He came around and told me, he said&mdash;he asked me if I had finished taking
the affidavits, and I told him, "Yes," and he said, "Captain Fritz wants you and
I to go out to Oswald's or Hidell's or Oswald's room."</p>

<p>On his person&mdash;he must have had&mdash;he did have identification with the name
Alex Hidell and Oswald&mdash;Lee Harvey Oswald, but Lt. E.&nbsp;L. Cunningham
of the forgery bureau, who used to be a member of the homicide and robbery
bureau before he made lieutenant, he went with us and we went out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you went out there, did you get a search warrant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No; we didn't&mdash;we didn't get a search warrant at that time. We
went to the location and talked to the people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's Lt. E.&nbsp;L. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. B.&nbsp;L. Senkel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. And myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went out to where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. 1026 North Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. We got there and we talked to this Mrs.&mdash;I believe her name was
Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. A.&nbsp;C. Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Earlene Roberts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; and they didn't know a Lee Harvey Oswald or an Alex
Hidell either one and they couldn't&mdash;they just didn't have any idea who we
were talking about, so the television&mdash;it is a rooming house, and there was a
<span class="locked">television&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you check their registration books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir; we looked at the registration book&mdash;Senkel, I think,
or Cunningham&mdash;well, we all looked through the registration book and there
wasn't anyone by that name, and the television was on in the living room. There's
an area there where the roomers sit, I guess it's the living quarters&mdash;it flashed
Oswald's picture on there and one of the women, either Mrs. Roberts or Mrs.
Johnson said, "That's the man that lives here. That's Mr. Lee&mdash;O.&nbsp;H. Lee." She
said, "His room is right here right off of the living room."</p>

<p>Senkel or Cunningham, one of them, called the office and they said that
Turner was en route with a search warrant and we waited there until 4:30
or 5 that afternoon. We got out there about 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You waited there in the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. We waited there in the living quarters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did not go into the small room that had been rented by Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No; we didn't&mdash;we didn't search the room at all until we got the
warrant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who brought the warrant out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Judge David Johnston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The judge issued it, but who brought it out?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, F.&nbsp;M. Turner and H.&nbsp;M. Moore was with him, and Judge
David Johnston was there, and also Assistant District Attorney Bill Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did David L. Johnston go too, the justice of the peace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, the judge was there in person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; and also Assistant District Attorney Bill Alexander&mdash;they
all came in the same car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, after we showed Johnson the search warrant, I think it was
Johnson, we went on in the room and continued to search the room, and we
took everything in there that we could find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you describe the room, the appearance of the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, the room was off&mdash;as you walk into the house, the living
area, the room was right there at the front door, and it was off to the left of
the living room. It was a real small room. It was, oh, I don't suppose it was
6 to 8 feet wide, and maybe 10 feet long. It was a real small room. It had
a half bed in there and back in the back there it had a shelf&mdash;some shelves and
stuff that he had some food and stuff back there in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How was it furnished?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, it just had the bed in there, and I believe, if remember, it
might have had a chair&mdash;I'm not sure. So, Moore, Senkel, Cunningham and
all of us&mdash;we searched that room&mdash;we took everything in there all but&mdash;there
was some food on the shelf we didn't take and we went through the trash can
and there was some banana peelings and stuff, but everything in there&mdash;we took
everything in there we could find. We even took the pillow cases off of one of
the pillows and put stuff in it. He had one of those little zipper-type bags and
he had a lot of stuff in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color was the bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I don't recall the color of that bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you bring it with you&mdash;you picked it up too, and brought it in,
too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir; we brought everything out of the room we could find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there curtains on the windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Hanging on rods?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. If I remember correctly, I think there was curtains on the walls,
but we looked behind the curtains and everything&mdash;and looked behind the blinds
and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you see anything of a leather holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. A .38 leather holster&mdash;I have a list there of all the stuff we
brought out of there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could I see that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir; you sure can. This is a list Mr. Turner and Mr. Moore
and myself compiled after we brought it into the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You brought the stuff into the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We'll mark this as "Potts Exhibit A."</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as "Potts Exhibit A," for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. You can have that if you would like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be two exhibits&mdash;A-1 and A-2.</p>

<p>(The instruments referred to marked by the reporter as "Potts Exhibits A-l
and A-2," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask Mrs. Johnson whether or not she had ever seen the
holster before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I don't recall asking her that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever ask Mrs. Earlene Roberts if she had seen the holster
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I don't recall talking to her about that. They weren't too familiar
with what was in that room. I didn't talk to them too much about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You recovered a Dallas city map, too, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes, sir; that had some markings on it in pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. There was a red notebook there that had a lot of names in it and
addresses in it and a lot of Russian writing&mdash;and it had a diagram of the Red
Square in there, I suppose, that's what it looked like to me. I suppose that's
what it was, but, of course, it was all written in Russian and about half of
that book I didn't understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You brought all of this property to the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you made the inventory we have had marked here as "Exhibits
A-1 and A-2"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; Mr. Moore and Turner and I compiled it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on that same day, did you do anything more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Let me say&mdash;later on in the afternoon&mdash;we worked the rest of that
night, up until&mdash;I don't recall what time I did leave there&mdash;it was pretty late.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here a document which has been marked as "Commission
Exhibit No. 426." Did you find this document at the 1026 North Beckley address
that day, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I recall seeing this; yes, I do. I don't know which one of the
officers picked it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember where it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do&mdash;you don't know where it was kept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But was it brought from the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; it was&mdash;here's my initial in the right hand corner, and
here is Mr. Moore's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What does that initial mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. That's my initial, "W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;P."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And there is "11-22-63"&mdash;what does that mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. That means&mdash;we initial all of the evidence we bring out of there.
At the time&mdash;this was going to court, and if this was brought out in court that
would be my initials right there&mdash;I recovered this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you initial it right there in the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. We initialed it after we brought it to the station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. These are the initials of the men who were there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. That's H.&nbsp;M. Moore and I guess it's F.&nbsp;M. Turner&mdash;"F.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;T."&mdash;that's
my partner. Yes, sir; for the purpose of identification in court, we
initialed everything we could possibly write on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you, on the 23d of November, take part in the investigation
of either the death of Oswald or the shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, I reported to work at 10 o'clock in the morning and we
worked until midnight that night&mdash;it was mostly telephone conversations&mdash;they
had to put extra phones in our office. We were swamped&mdash;I talked to people
from England, Canada, Peru&mdash;all over was just calling in there&mdash;just a continual
call&mdash;call&mdash;call&mdash;and it kept most of us real busy answering telephone calls
that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take part in any showup of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I believe I did&mdash;was that the 23d&mdash;at 2:15 that afternoon on the
23d, I was in on one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Mr. Senkel and I went to the jail and stood by the jail elevator
and waited until the showup came down, and I was thinking there was M.&nbsp;G.
Hall and Charlie Brown and a jailer or two that brought that showup down.
They were all handcuffed together, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is M.&nbsp;G. Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. He is a detective in our bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who is Charlie Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Charlie Brown is also an officer assigned to the bureau. Now,
I might be wrong about that, but it seems to me like they were the two that
showed up then, but they might not have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you have anything to do with the selection of the men
who were to be in the showup?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No, sir; all I did was just to go down to the jail door and
walk with the showup out to the stage, and I stood out on the stage while
the showup was conducted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How was it conducted? Describe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, there is an anteroom before you get to the showup stage.
Now, the witnesses were out front behind this transparent black nylon screen.
There's a light set at an angle on the stage where the person on the stage
can't see the people out in the audience. They brought them out handcuffed
together and this John Thurman Horne went in first&mdash;no, that's wrong&mdash;Lujan
went on first, because he would be No. 4. You see, they're got numbers above
the&mdash;above them higher up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Daniel Lujan, and then Oswald was No. 3, Knapp No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is Knapp's full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. David Knapp and John Thurman Horne was No. 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what happened then, after they went out on the stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, Detective Leavelle&mdash;now, I don't know who the witness was
that they were showing them to&mdash;the showup to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear Leavelle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I heard Leavelle question each one of the men. There is a black
square on the floor and he tells each one of them to take one step forward and
they have a microphone above, and I don't recall exactly what he asked them&mdash;It
was just to get them to talk and identify themselves. We conduct them
different&mdash;sometimes we ask them their names and their address and their
occupation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Leavelle ask the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; he was up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And, did he direct his questions to the men on the stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; to the men on the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; I heard them answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald speak up or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, he was complaining all during the showup. He had on a
T-shirt and the rest of them didn't have on T-shirts, and he was complaining,
"Well, everybody's got on a shirt and everything, and I've got a T-shirt on"&mdash;he
was very belligerent about the showup. He wouldn't cooperate in any way.
He was just making all kinds of commotion out there and he was doing more
of the talking than anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of commotion was he making?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, he was doing a lot of talking about him being in a T-shirt,
and "nobody else has got on a T-shirt and I've got on a T-shirt, this is unfair,"
and all that&mdash;just generally talking and after the showup was over, we just
accompanied them back from the stage out to the anteroom door and just
walked along with them and the elevator&mdash;took them on the elevator, and that's
all we had to do with the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all you had to do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were the appearances of the four men who came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. They were similar in size&mdash;I didn't pick them&mdash;I don't know who
did, but they were generally the same size, and, of course, the ages are a little
different here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What ages were they, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, Horne was 17&mdash;he was born November 6, 1945, I believe
that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. John Thurman Horne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; and this David Edmond Knapp, he was 18. He was born
October 22, 1945, and this Daniel Lujan, he was 26, and he was born February 15,
1937.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you have the addresses of these three men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; I do&mdash;now, I got the addresses off of&mdash;out of our records
bureau&mdash;off of their arrest cards. I don't know whether they gave a fictitious
address or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Now, Horne is 2942 Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 2942 Ann Arbor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that's Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; that's in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was he charged with&mdash;why was he in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Traffic tickets&mdash;he had a number of traffic tickets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Traffic tickets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; he had a stack of them&mdash;all on the same arrest date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes&mdash;red lights and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what about David Knapp, what was he in for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. He was in for investigation of theft and he lived at 2922 Alabama.
That's in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he was in for investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Investigation of burglary and theft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he convicted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Well, I don't know anything about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know where he is now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No, sir; I have never seen those men since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know whether he was convicted or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Lujan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Daniel Lujan&mdash;[spelling] L-u-j-a-n, I guess that's the way you
pronounce it. He was born February 15, 1937, and gave the address of 1804
Lear [spelling] L-e-a-r Street, and he was in for investigation of violation of
State narcotic laws.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And was he convicted, or do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know if any one of these men has ever been convicted of
a felony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know nothing about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I know nothing about them at all. In fact, that's the first time
I have ever seen them and I suppose the last time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you take any further part in the investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. That Presidential assassination&mdash;I think that's about all I done
on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that one day you went out and talked to Mr. Fischer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes; I talked to a boy named Fischer&mdash;on the 25th of November.
Of course, you know I was off duty on the Ruby thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. I was at home then and I was sitting there and my wife said,
"They are going to televise this transfer of Oswald." I said, "I've seen enough
of that and I don't want to look at it." And she said, "We need milk and bread
for lunch," and so I got up and got in the car and went to Safeway and was
standing in line to check out there and a woman&mdash;well, it looked like a woman&mdash;came
out and said, "Oswald has just been shot." Well, I thought that was a
big joke, too, and went back out there and turned on the car radio and there
that was. I came on back on duty that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went out to see Mr. <span class="locked">Fischer&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Now, Mr. Turner had this information about this Fischer man. He
and Mr. Senkel&mdash;they were in the motorcade that day. In fact, they were in
the lead car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Senkel was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Senkel, Turner, and Chief Lumpkin were in the lead car in the
motorcade, and I think Turner had gotten this information about this Fischer
fellow. I had never heard about him until Turner asked me, he said, "Let's go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
out and talk to this Mr. Fischer." He said, "He is supposed to have been standing
down there watching the parade go by and he saw this man in this window,"
and he wanted to know&mdash;we took a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald out there to
see if he could identify him as being the man he saw in the window, and we went
out there on the 25th of November with Lee Harvey Oswald's picture to 4007
Flamingo Street in Mesquite. That's where this Ronald Fischer lives, and he
works for the county auditor's office down there. He was working that day and
most of the county employees stood out on the street to watch the parade, and
we took his picture out there and he said, "I can't say for sure that's the man
that I saw in that window up there, but it looks like him." He said he saw him
up there just a few minutes before he heard the shots fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you made written reports of these investigations you are
testifying about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have refreshed your memory from them&mdash;from your own
handwritten notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. That's right&mdash;I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have marked your report on your officer's duty on
Friday, November 22, and also on the 23d and 25th of November, being two
sheets, numbered 230 and 231, as the next exhibit, and page 3 of your report,
being No. 232, being a report of your participation in the showup on November
23, 1963, at 2:15&mdash;as the next exhibit.</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as "Potts Exhibits B and C,"
respectively, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all and I do want to thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. You are certainly welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be written up and you can come down and read it and
sign it or you can waive your signature and we will send it on to the Commission.
You can tell me what you want to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Potts</span>. Oh, I will sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, then you will be notified when it is ready for you to sign.</p>

<h2 id="t202">TESTIMONY OF JOHN P. ADAMCIK</h2>

<p>The testimony of John P. Adamcik was taken at 10 a.m., on April 3, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you want to stand and raise your right hand, sir?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you please state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. John P. Adamcik.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I live right now at 4621 Samuell Boulevard, apartment 166.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That is over in the eastern part of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. It is in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I am 26.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I am a detective with the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to school in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go to high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. LaGrange, Tex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. LaGrange High School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I worked there in LaGrange for a short period of time, and
came to Dallas and worked for Temco Aircraft Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I was an assembler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Then I went in the Marine Corps for a short period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long were you in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I was in there approximately 2 months, got out on a hardship
discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it an honorable discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes; I got an honorable discharge&mdash;hardship discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I went home and assisted the family, because my father was
injured. That was the reason I got the discharge.</p>

<p>And I don't know, I got everybody going in shape which would be, I think
it was probably around a year, and I came back to Dallas and got on the police
department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you have been in the police department ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Every since, except I took another 6-month leave of absence
and I spent 6 months on active duty with the U.S. Army Reserves. After the
hardship ended, I went back in the Army for 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your position with the Dallas Police Department is now what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Detective in the homicide and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. One-month-old baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A month old baby. Boy or girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You must be pretty proud?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Mark Allen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your wife taking good care of that baby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer, first I want to talk about November 22, 1963. Were you
on duty on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No, sir; I wasn't, not at the time pertaining to this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Not at the time of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were off duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I was at home, off duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you get on duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I was supposed to go on at 3. However, when I heard of
the assassination&mdash;I was supposed to go to court at 2 o'clock, and I reported down
to the courts and the courts were closed, so I immediately reported to my
office, which was about 2 or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were at the office the rest of the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No, sir. I stayed at the office a short period of time. I wasn't
there over an hour when Oswald was brought in by the arresting officers and
we were asked&mdash;Detectives Stovall and Rose and myself were asked by Captain
Fritz and the supervisor to go to his residence in Irving, to the Paine residence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Oswald give them that address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't know. I don't recall whether he gave them the address
or they found it on his person in evidence as identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was the address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. 2515 West Fifth Street, Irving. I don't have any idea how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
that came about at all. All I remember is that we were told to go to this
address. I don't even remember whether we had a name, a definite name. We
were told to go to this address, that this was the address he had on his person,
or something similar to that, and we did what we were told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. This was approximately 2:30. Could I use my report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sure. You take your report out and refresh your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I have it on here, the times mainly. This would be approximately
2:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, did you have a search warrant when you went out
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No, sir; we did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular reason why you didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, at the time, we didn't know what we would find. We
didn't have any idea what this address meant to us, and we were mainly going
over to see who was there.</p>

<p>We decided if we were not allowed in the house, invited in, that we could
get a search warrant later to go in, whereas at the time we didn't have any
idea that that address actually had any connection with these people or with
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did you go with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I went with Detectives Rose and Stovall, and we were met by
three county officers there at the scene before we went up, because being out
of the city limits of Dallas, we had three county officers go along with us,
because it was in their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What time did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I would say that it didn't take us over, it probably took us
half an hour to get there. I would say it would be approximately 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. We waited a few minutes for the county officers to get there,
and when they got there we came outside, and I went with one of the county
officers or two of the county officers to the back door, and one of the county
officers and Detectives Rose and Stovall went to the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. We waited until Detectives Rose and Stovall and the county
officers got inside the house, which was a period of time of maybe 3 or 4 minutes
when they were invited in, and they came to the back door and opened it up
and asked us to come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who asked you to come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Detectives Rose and Stovall, plus&mdash;because Mrs. Paine was in
the house at the time standing next to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, we started looking around the house. I think Detectives
Rose and Stovall handled most of the interrogation. They asked the questions
of Mrs. Paine, and Mrs. Oswald, after we found out who they were&mdash;and I
didn't do any interrogating at the time at all, I just sort of stood and listened,
and we started looking around.</p>

<p>We asked them where Mr. Oswald was, and various things, and we looked
around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Mrs. Oswald say about whether or not you could see
her room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. She never did say anything at all. In fact, she showed us
where the room was and showed us several things in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Mrs. Paine do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. She didn't object at all. They were really very cooperative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what the interrogation was? Who said what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I don't recall. I assume it was, you know, they asked
her who she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone ask when was the last time they saw Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Oh, yes; I heard it asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was the answer given, if you remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, did they take you out to the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Not me. They took two of&mdash;some of the officers. I think
it was Detectives Stovall and Rose, to the garage. I think it was through Mrs.
Oswald that she went ahead and told Mrs. Paine something, and Mrs. Paine
drew their attention to the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone say anything about a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I didn't hear it. I wasn't present when they went in the
garage at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, we stayed in the house for a good while, and we called,
or one of our men called in the office, I didn't, and asked them what they should
do. And of course they told them to bring the people in, that they wanted to
talk to them at the office. And we told them about it and they agreed that they
would go. And of course our problem was the children. There was some
children, both of Mrs. Oswald's children were there, and I don't remember, I
believe Mrs. Paine's were there, and we wondered where they would stay, or
make some arrangements for the neighbors to keep them or not, and if I
remember correctly, after we were there a while, Michael Paine, Mrs. Paine's
husband came in. We have it here someplace what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear what Michael Paine said when he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes. He came in about 3:45 and told his wife that he heard
the President was shot and he came over to see whether he could help, and
they were surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he said he heard the President was shot and he came over
to see if he could help, why would he help her if the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't know. Apparently in the affidavit, I was present.</p>

<p>Later on he said that his first idea when he heard that the President was shot
was that Oswald could have been the one that done it, when he found out
about the location, so apparently he figured that somebody would be over there
questioning them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, we went through the house, if I remember correctly, and
I believe the other detectives found some property. I know they found this
blanket that was rolled up in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you there when they saw the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I wasn't there. I saw the blanket later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was it when you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I believe they took it in the house. I am pretty sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had they unrolled the blanket when they took it in the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; they had a string still tied around it. Apparently had
two strings, and just one of the strings were cut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. One of the strings was cut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who cut it, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had it been cut by an officer of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; it definitely wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Definitely wasn't. As far as I know, it wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How was the blanket rolled, do you know, offhand, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. It appeared to be 4 or 5 feet, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything in the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Not that I could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the blanket stiff or limp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. It was a regular wool blanket, and it wasn't fairly stiff. Just
from being rolled that way, it didn't appear like it was real stiff. Just normal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone carrying the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you lift the blanket up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I never did lift the blanket up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened after it was brought inside?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't recall then at all. I left the house after awhile and
went with, I believe it was, Mrs. Paine. I went with her to one of the neighbor
houses to see about the children, leaving the children there. I left and went
with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Coming back, Mrs. Frazier, I believe it was, drove up to the
house as I was coming back with&mdash;no, it was Mrs. Bill Randle. She (Mrs.
Randle) was a neighbor there and she was driving up to the house, so I asked
her whether she knew anything about what had happened, and whether she
had seen Lee Oswald, and she did tell me that Lee Oswald rode to work with
her brother, which is Wesley Frazier, who was staying with her, and he rode
to work with him that morning.</p>

<p>She told me that she saw&mdash;she was up early in the morning and was drinking
coffee, and saw Lee Harvey Oswald go across the front yard, across the yard
carrying like a long package wrapped in something, carrying it from the Paine
house to Wesley's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say how he was carrying the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; she didn't. I think we got an affidavit. In fact, I know
we did, but I didn't take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say about how long the package was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; she said it was long and wrapped in a paper or a box.
That is all I remember her saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else on there? Did she say anything that it was unusual
for Oswald to be home at all during the week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes; she did say that. That Oswald usually spent the weekends
over there, and it was unusual for him to be there on a Thursday night
and go to work with him on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you remember offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I don't believe I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. By then we went ahead and took these people and put them
in a car. I think Mrs. Oswald took both the children. Mrs. Paine got a neighbor
to keep her children and Mrs. Oswald and her two children were put in
our car, the city police car, and Mrs. Paine also went with us, and Michael
Paine, Mrs. Paine's husband, went with the county officer, and we proceeded to
go to the city police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. We took them up to the homicide and robbery bureau office
and conditions were very crowded there, so we moved up to the forgery bureau
next door, and we put them in the interrogation room and waited a pretty good
while.</p>

<p>By this time it was approximately 6 p.m., and I think they were trying to get
an interpreter and question Mrs. Oswald. That was the reason for the wait.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Oh, yes, after talking to this Mrs. Randle, we wanted to talk
to Wesley Frazier, and she said that he was at Parkland visiting his sick daddy.</p>

<p>So when we got back to the station, we checked with Parkland and couldn't
find anybody by that name over there, so we checked with the clinic there in
Irving, I believe it was, Irving Professional Center, and found out that he was
there. The nurse checked the room, and he was there at the time, so some
of the detectives called out there and had him placed in custody at that time
so we could get an affidavit from him or question him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. However, I didn't go back over there and get him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got down to the station, you were with Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Right. When we got to the station, there was Mrs. Paine,
Mrs. Oswald and her two children, and Michael Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Mrs. Oswald questioned at all or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Mrs. Oswald, yes; she was. She was questioned that same
evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, she was questioned through an interpreter, and an affidavit
was gotten from her also. I know she was showed the rifle in my presence.</p>

<p>I was there with Captain Fritz and myself and Detective Senkel, and the
rifle was showed to her then, and she looked at it, and I remember her saying
through an interpreter that it did look like the rifle, but she didn't say, but it
did look like the rifle that Lee Oswald, that was in the garage previous to
finding the blanket eventually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say finding the blanket eventually, did she say the
blanket was there?</p>

<p>Was it simply that when you showed the blanket to the officers, apparently
she made some remark that about a week or so previous to that her husband's
rifle had been wrapped in a blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I can't remember exactly how long. I don't remember when
she said the last time was she saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine indicate she ever saw the rifle there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I can't remember. I took an affidavit, and I know I questioned
her about the rifle, and I can't remember whether she ever said.</p>

<p>I would have to see the affidavit. I don't have a copy. I don't believe she
said she seen the rifle. I believe that she said she saw the blanket there, but
I am sure that that would be in the affidavit. That would be in the affidavit,
though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now anything else happen there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; after Mrs. Oswald was questioned, I took an affidavit from
Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I think this other detective, I think Senkel, probably took one
from Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean Marina, Lee Oswald's wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That's right, the wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Shortly after we got through with him, with this, I believe
Lee Oswald's mother came in. I don't remember whether she had been in
previous and was in some other office, but I know they brought her in the same
office we were in at that time, and after we got through, they were all sitting
in the same room together, Mrs. Oswald, Lee's mother, and the wife, and the
children, and Mrs. Paine, and Michael Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Lee Oswald's mother say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; she kind of didn't say anything definite. She kind of had
the feeling&mdash;I don't know how to explain it&mdash;just like this, well, she didn't
realize what really happened and just couldn't quite understand it, or something.
She didn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Lee Oswald's brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. To me, he was in there, too. I didn't break that up. He
seemed rather calm to me. He was real calm and real collected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Not to me, not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I was asked by Captain Fritz to take these people home, and
he wanted me to take someone with me, and I took Lieutenant McKinney, who
was one of the lieutenants in the forgery bureau. I used his car, and he went
along with me to take these people home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do? First of all, did they say anything more
on the way home about the incident or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I believe the only thing I definitely remember is that
Marina Oswald kept saying, telling Mrs. Oswald that this was her home, and
she still decided she would like to stay here. She didn't want to go back to
Russia. I remember her saying that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember someone saying that through an interpreter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Right. Mrs. Paine was there, and she could interpret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. She wasn't real good, but she could speak enough Russian to
interpret a little bit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. We took them to Irving, to the Paine house. At this time
I believe Mrs. Oswald was the only other person that we took back there to the
Paine house that didn't come down to the station with us originally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes; the mother, she went back with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, this was fairly late. I guess it was around 10 o'clock when
we got back, so apparently it was around 9 when we started taking them to
Irving, and got back about 10.</p>

<p>We just dropped them off at the house and went on back to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got back to the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Went to the office and I stayed there a while, and I guess it
was around 11 o'clock, I mean the interrogation room in the captain's office,
and spent about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you go in the interrogation room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, at that time I think somebody else just finished talking
to him, and I think the captain had to go see somebody or something, and
nobody was in the room at the time, and he told us to go on in there for a little
while and see whether we could talk to Oswald.</p>

<p>I think Detective Montgomery went in there with me, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you the only two in there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes; I think so. The ID Bureau came in there and either
fingerprinted him or done something. When they came in there, I left. It was
just a short period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember any conversation that took place there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; except I asked him whether he drove a car. I did ask
him that. And I remember him saying something that he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That he did or did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That he did not. And I asked him how long he was in Russia
and whether he liked it there, and I remember him telling me how long he was
there. I think it was two years, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't remember exactly what he said, and he liked it okay,
and that is just about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk about the assassination at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; it wasn't anything at all concerned with the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ask him any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. We did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Like what kind of questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Like where were you at the time this assassination occurred;
and he just wouldn't say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he just keep quiet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. He just sat there and stared straight ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Didn't talk at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ask for an attorney while you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ask him any questions about Officer Tippit's murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I don't believe that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone else there that did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I didn't hear anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, I just stayed at the office until about 2 o'clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Ever see Oswald again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I seen him being led out of the office from the interview, I believe.
I didn't go down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I think they had&mdash;I don't know whether it was an interview
or some kind of press conference down in the assembly room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When would that have been?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. It would have been about midnight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know if Oswald requested it or if someone else did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I stayed in the office after Captain Fritz and the other men
came back. He told us to go on home and come back the next morning about
10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, I went home, and about 10 or shortly before 10, I came in,
and Captain Fritz asked Detectives Rose and Stovall; and Detective Moore&mdash;at
this time he was a regular partner of Rose and Stovall&mdash;asked me, since I
was there the previous day, to go along back to Mrs. Paine's house for a little
more complete search.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have a search warrant at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes; we stopped by and got a search warrant from Judge
Joe B. Brown, Jr., over in Oak Cliff, and came by his house and picked up the
search warrant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. We got out to the house. I didn't have a search warrant.
One of the other detectives did. They told us to come on in, and they were
there.</p>

<p>I remember at the time we came in, that they were going grocery shopping,
and they left and just told us to look at anything we wanted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The previous day had you taken anything out of the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did any of the officers take anything out of the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes; some of the other officers did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did they take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't recall. I believe they took some camera equipment.
It might have been a movie camera or projector. I didn't take anything. I
know they took some items.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; there weren't too many items the first day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the second day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. The second day we made a pretty complete search. We
went mainly in the garage. We had also an Irving police officer. It was, I
think, Detective McCabe from the Irving police department. And we went
through the house and garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you take with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, we picked up&mdash;I got a list of it, also, which we turned
over to the FBI, but we picked up items such as letters and pictures and oh,
just a whole bunch of items.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you find the picture of Oswald with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I didn't find it. It was found while I was back in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That was found in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any comments about that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Naturally, when somebody found it, we all looked at it, and
everybody said, "That looks like the rifle that was used in the assassination."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Mrs. Paine or Mrs. Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No. At that time they weren't there. They were grocery
shopping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you show the picture to them later on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. The picture was shown to them, but it wasn't there at the scene,
and it was shown at the office, I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You weren't there when it was done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Well, no other than&mdash;I didn't even begin to tell you what all we
found. It was books and pictures and they found some of his stuff from the
Marine Corps when he was in the Marine Corps, and a lot of Russian, I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
they were books on the Russian language, and some vaccination certificates and
stuff like that.</p>

<p>A lot of stuff was written in Russian, and we didn't have any idea what it said.
Even the letters, a lot of them were written in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I don't recall anything pertaining to the search at all. I
know that everything we&mdash;at the time, that we felt it was important, as far as
investigation of the murder of the President and Officer Tippit was concerned,
we took with us. There might have been some things we didn't take, but at the
time the search was conducted, it was conducted more or less for each person
at the same time, for the murder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was an inventory made of the items taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. There was. Yes; there was, definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You put that on file with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. There was an inventory made, and there was receipts for all
the property, and it is itemized. Everything is itemized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I know the search took a pretty good while. We didn't get
back to the office until about 4 p.m., so I assume we got there probably around 11
or 11:30, and we stayed there 3 or 4 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else at all that you can think of that is important?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't know who found it. It was either Stovall or Rose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Adamcik, I will hand you what appears to be a document
from the Dallas Police Department entitled, "Property clerk's invoice or receipt."
It is an inventory. It commences with page No. 11177G through 11193G, and
ask you to state if this appears to be a copy of the inventory that you picked
up out on your search there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Let me see if I can see all these. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, rather than offer it in this deposition, I believe you said
that&mdash;who was the senior officer out there among you, or wasn't there any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes; there was. I was not the senior officer conducting
the search. Probably Detective Rose, although I believe Detective Moore
might have been previous, but since Detective Rose was there the previous day,
he was spokesman for the group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Stovall work more with you or with Rose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. With Rose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe Mr. Ball is about to take the deposition of R.&nbsp;S. Stovall,
and I think what we will do is give this inventory to Mr. Ball and let him introduce
it in that deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That first day I couldn't tell you anything because I was out of
the house trying to take care of the kids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you can think of, officer, that we haven't
discussed here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No. The only thing is, after we finished conducting the search
and got back to the office, I remember the previous day we didn't take an
affidavit from Michael Paine, so Detective Moore and myself went back to
Irving&mdash;should be around 5 o'clock, and picked up Mr. Paine and brought him
back to the office for somebody to take an affidavit from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything, that you remember, when you were taking
the affidavit, about the rifle or the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. He did. I was present when he said it, and it is in the affidavit,
about seeing the blanket in which the rifle was wrapped in, or he assumed it
was the blanket in which the rifle was wrapped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he know that it contained a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I don't think so. But he said he had seen it several times
previous to the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything about why he came to his wife's residence
that day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes, sir; he did. I brought that out in the affidavit, and I
remember something about him saying when he heard that the President got
killed, well, knowing where it occurred and where Lee Oswald worked, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
knowing his background, well, he said that Oswald's name came into his mind
immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say it came into his mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. He said, knowing about his background and all&mdash;I remember
just about what he said&mdash;that he knew that he would be asked to be considered
a suspect, and&mdash;or that we would consider him a suspect, something. He didn't
say who, but the way the situation was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say what it was in his background that would make him
considered to be a suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. It is in the affidavit, and I can't remember what he said.
Whether he said it was because he was in Russia at one time, or something about
him being a Russian citizen, or whether it was because for some other reason.</p>

<p>Anyway, it is in the affidavit. I can't think exactly what he said. It is worded
pretty well, because he signed the affidavit and it is in his words. I can look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here is an affidavit that appears to be signed by Michael Paine.
He says that he felt concern for his wife, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Right; he did say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He says that he saw a heavy pipelike object wrapped in a blanket,
tied with a string. Is that what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That is what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He said, "I picked it up to get it out of the way of the powersaw."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That is what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say he had a lot of tools, and he mentioned he picked up
this object and put it out of the way of his powersaw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And it says in the affidavit he thought it was tenting equipment.
Is that what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He says later in the affidavit that he heard the President was
shot while he was at work, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He said he heard the shots were from the Texas School Book
Depository, and he said that he knew that Oswald worked there, and immediately
thought of him, and wondered if he might have shot the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That is what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He says he wondered if he should call the FBI. Is that what he
says in the affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. That's right, exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He says he thought it unlikely that he shot the President. Did
he say that he thought it was unlikely that Oswald shot the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes; he said that. And then he explained why he didn't call
the FBI. He said he figured that&mdash;he did mention that the FBI knew about
Oswald and that they would probably have contacted him and would consider
him a suspect without him having to call them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say why the FBI knew about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. No; I believe that is it. After we picked him up and took this
affidavit just shortly after, I went on home and that was the end of it, until
Sunday. Sunday I was off, and everything happened down there, luckily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Luckily you were off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir; we want to thank you for your cooperation for coming down
here. You have an opportunity to either let the deposition go directly to Washington,
or you can come back and read it and sign it. You can waive the signing,
or come back and read it and sign it, whatever you want to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. About how long would it be before it is ready?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Several days. You want to sign, or just let her send it on to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. I would kind of like to look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, this lady will get in touch with you and you can take a
look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adamcik</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Oh, I fooled around on the farm about 3 years, and then I came

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. 1 or 1:30, somewhere around there. Maybe 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Well, I helped answer telephones mostly for, oh, I don't know,
until the time I went out to North Beckley to search Oswald's room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At 1026 North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; I believe that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I am going to guess around 6 or so in the evening. The notes
may show a little closer time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have a search warrant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who got it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. The Judge issued it. Judge David Johnston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he go with you there, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who else went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. District Attorney Bill Alexander and Detective F.&nbsp;M. Turner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went to that address, and did the landlady&mdash;let me ask you
this. You got to the door at 1026 North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; we met some other officers there. They were already inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At that time they found out that Lee Harvey Oswald lived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I believe they had; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. We searched his room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Brought everything in the room to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You made a list of what you found there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything in particular that you found there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; one map, city of Dallas map, and it had several marks
located on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Personal effects, clothing, radio, and gun scabbard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. A holster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. .38 pistol, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you find the gun itself, or just the holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No; just the holster. I believe they had recovered the gun from
him earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else there that you can establish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I believe I mentioned his clothing, personal effects?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Some letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; I'm sure there were some letters and papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pamphlets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I am not sure. I believe there was some. I am not sure, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to hand you a copy which appears to be a photostatic
copy of a property clerk's invoice or receipt. By the way, how many
times did you go to 1026 North Beckley?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I only went one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone else search the room next day, or do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I don't know. I don't remember. I can't see any point. We
brought everything that was in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You brought everything there? I am handing you pages marked
on this police department, "City of Dallas property clerk's invoice or receipt
No. 11194G through 11199G." Does this appear to be a copy of the inventory
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We will call that Moore Deposition Exhibit No. 1. I might state
for the record that this appears to be&mdash;what was the last number I gave
there&mdash;it looks like 11200G, and I might state for the record that these appear
also in the Dallas police report file which is known in the President's Commission
files as document 81B, pages 280&ndash;286, inclusive.</p>

<p>I note then on this list it states that the search warrant is dated November 23,
1963, which is 1 day later than the date that you made the search. Do you
have any explanation for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No; I wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the original search warrant at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I also notice there appears to be included in these articles a
driver's handbook of the State of Texas. Do you remember whether or not
that was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. It would be hard to say any one personal item of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, you couldn't remember anything specifically there
except you do know that you put down on the list, or participated in putting
down on the list everything that was picked up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything on this list, to the best of your knowledge, that
was not picked up out at 1026 North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I noticed that there is an envelope which is marked "Envelope
containing receipt for post office box 6225, Dallas, Tex., dated November 11,
1963, for the period ending December 31, 1963." Do you have any independent
recollection of that being there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that, you mean you cannot specifically recall now except you
do know that someone put it down on the list as being obtained from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I also note that one of the items appears to be a World Health
Organization vaccination card, bearing the name of Lee Oswald, with the name
of the vaccinator as A.&nbsp;J. Hidell, post office box 30016, New Orleans, La., with
the date stamped June 8, 1963.</p>

<p>Do you remember anything like that, one of those health cards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Not specifically no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And it says that there is a passport there. Do you remember
that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You remember specifically the passport?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then there is an application for a Texas driver's license, which
appears as No. 450. Do you remember that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; I do, since I have read the list. I remember the driver's
license application.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you Commission Exhibit 426, and ask you to state if you
know what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Application for Texas driver's license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You picked it up there or someone with you picked it up on that
day that you searched the residence at Beckley?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; you find my initials on the back of it, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your initials, it says, HMM, 11-12-63. Those are your initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; and date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who FMT is, or are those initials there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I believe that will be F.&nbsp;M. Turner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. F.&nbsp;M. Turner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I believe. That is the only one I could think of it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. About how long did you stay out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Hour and a half, possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. We drove back to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I assume then that you went through the property and marked
it, and what have you. This took a little bit of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else on that day that has anything else to do with
the assassination of the President or the Tippit murder that you can think of
offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The next day you reported for work about when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. As soon after the Oswald shooting in the basement, as soon as
I could get there. I live out of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Wait, that is when Oswald was shot. I am not talking about
Sunday. I am talking about Saturday. When did you search the Beckley
premises? On Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Saturday. No; we searched it on Friday. Irving on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Irving on Saturday. When did you get to work on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I believe I came in around 10 that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you worked in the office for a while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what you did offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Answered the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I went out with Stovall and Rose and Adamcik to Irving later
in the day to search the residence at Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that be 2515 West Fifth Street in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had a search warrant for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You found several items there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Made a list of those similar to this other list?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else? Do you remember any conversation you had
out there with Mrs. Paine or Mrs. Oswald, Marina Oswald, or anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. When we arrived, they were preparing to leave and did leave.
We had an Irving officer with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they tell you to go ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes, they did; just go ahead and help ourselves. They said
they would be back later, and I am not sure that they even returned before we
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything particularly you found out there
that stands out in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Rose found the picture of Oswald holding the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Rose show it to you out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes, he did; at the time he found it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you near him when he found it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far away was he from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. This was a one-car garage, and it would have to be close. Four
men searching in that garage. I would say a matter of 3 or 4 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Rose say to you when he found it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. He said, "Look at this." Of course we all looked and commented
on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Well, we continued our search, and after we had completed it,
we again brought everything that we had picked up to our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You made another list of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you did that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you bring in Michael Paine for taking an affidavit from him,
do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes, I did. Mr. Adamcik and I went out and brought&mdash;we went
back to the residence and brought him in later that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You talked to him for a while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you took the affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then the next day was the 24th of November, Sunday. Were you
on duty Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you get to work on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Approximately 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I am sure I worked around the office until the time that Rose and
I went to Ruby's apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have a search warrant for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes. We went to Judge Joe B. Brown's residence and got the
search warrant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is it pretty much standard procedure at the Dallas Police Department
to have a search warrant whenever you go to a person's premises?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. More or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you don't have a search warrant, what is your procedure when
you come to the door? Just what do you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. If we do not have a search warrant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Well, it would all depend on why we were going, really. If we
got a search warrant, if we were looking for stolen property, or things of that
nature, we would most probably have one. If we did not have one, if people
invited us in, it would be legal to be in the house anyway. And if they don't
invite us in, or tell us we can't enter, then in all probability we will get a search
warrant and go in anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of that is important in any way that
bears on this investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Moore, do we call you officer or detective or mister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have an opportunity, if you like, to come back and read this
deposition and sign it before it comes to us in Washington, or you can just
waive signing and let the court reporter send it to us directly in Washington.
Do you have any preference or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You want to sign, or do you want to waive signing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. What is the procedure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, if you sign it, you come back and read it and then you sign it
if it is accurate; otherwise, you leave it and we assume the court reporter is
accurate, and she will send it to us as the record of your testimony here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. I believe I would rather read it. No reflection on the reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, she is too nice a reporter. If you would like to read it, why
you certainly have that right, and the reporter will be getting in touch with
you. Do we have your address, or can she contact you at the Dallas Police
Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes; she can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can come in and read it and she will send it to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We thank you very much for your splendid cooperation. Good-bye.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t217">TESTIMONY OF F.&nbsp;M. TURNER</h2>

Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's

solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Detective of the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Murphy, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Spent all your life in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Except for a couple of years in the service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that after you got out of high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you go in high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Finished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You finished high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Went in the service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that high school in Murphy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; it was Plano, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the Army or Navy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Coast Guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Coast Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I was a storekeeper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have a discharge from the Coast Guard, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you get an honorable discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. When I first came out, I went to work as a carpenter's helper up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
around Plano there. I worked at that a short while. And then I worked for
the Plano Lumber Yard in Richardson, Tex., and I worked there until I came
to work for the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I did; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I was riding in the pilot car of the motorcade, possibly 3 minutes
in front of the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who else was with your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Chief Lumpkin from our department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is he an assistant chief of police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Deputy chief of police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. My partner, Detective B.&nbsp;L. Senkel, and an Army major whose
name I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went to Love Field to meet the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. In the car also was a Secret Service man, whose name I do
not remember. Yes, sir; I did go to Love Field to meet the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw the plane arrive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got prepared to leave a little bit ahead of time of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We did. We drove to a gate on the outward edge of Love Field
and waited until we got some radio contact from the chief. They were about
ready to leave, and we had a running start.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many channels did you have on your radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which channel were you on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Channel 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the entire motorcade on channel 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. The entire motorcade was on channel 2, and I believe there was
a dispatcher at the central station on channel 2, that relayed some of the
changes, and some of the messages were car to car, back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Other police business would be on channel 1, at the time, or also
on channel 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Other police business was on channel 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you went through the city ahead of the actual motorcade,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you keep track of where the motorcade was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; by radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By radio did you keep track of how fast the motorcade was going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; by radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not there was any radio conversation
as to how fast the motorcade was going at the time it got to Main and
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did you keep your primary radio contact with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Chief Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now where were you when you first heard any signs of anything
out of the ordinary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We were on Stemmons Freeway. I don't recall approximately,
at the Oak Lawn exit, or somewhere right in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you hear on the police radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, I heard some conversation, either sounded like Curry's
voice or Sheriff Decker's voice, who was riding in the car with him. I believe
it said, sounded like Sheriff Decker said notify all men to get over there and
cover off the area around this building there until some investigators could get
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you return to the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, yes; but I don't believe he mentioned that building. I
believe he just mentioned the overpass over the Elm Street. He said cover off
that area around the overpass, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the President's car come by your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Out on the expressway, I did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was the President's car headed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We fell in behind it in our car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went over to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We went up by the exit there and helped sort of control the
crowd, and I never did go in. They unloaded the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you watch them unload the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Off and on, I mean, I was more or less mingling in the crowd,
trying to restrain the crowd where they could have room to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see how they unloaded Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see how they unloaded the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We got back in Chief Lumpkin's car along with him, and we
come back to the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you get back there, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. In relation to time, I don't know. But it was just about a short
while. I would say, I don't know, 10 or 15 minutes after it happened. We
just started out there in a matter of minutes, and we drove code 3, with the
sirens on, and we came back down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Chief Lumpkin told me to search out a caboose to a train that
was parked at the rear of the building. I went in and searched this boxcar out,
and come out of there, and by that time they were already in the building, I
supposed. I went in the building and that is when I ran across this Mr. Campbell
and Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now let me ask you this. Did you find anything in the boxcar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any railroad employee over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. At the boxcar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Or in this area, did you talk to anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No sir; this was a caboose of a boxcar, that is what it was,
sitting there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to anyone over there that indicated where they
heard the shots came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Talked to these people from the School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Prior to the time you got to the School Book Depository, did you
talk to anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, you say you saw Mr. Campbell and Mr. Truly, and
who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Mr. Molina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They all worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes; they said they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you talk to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Down on the first floor of this building, back sort of a warehouse
like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they say where they heard the shots come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did they say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, I believe they said they thought they all came from west of
the building at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they say where they were when they heard the shots, when
the shots came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, according to my notes, Mr. Truly stated that he was at
the front of the store watching the parade in the front of the building, and
Mr. Campbell had walked across the street, and this Joe Molina, I don't have
on here where he was. He just said he worked in the warehouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is all your notes show on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Said they all thought the sound came from west of their
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Can I take a look at that book of yours? It might cut down the
questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes; this is more or less some notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are handing me kind of a spiral notebook that you have. I
notice here, well, let me ask you this. Then what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. About that time there was a deputy sheriff, Mr. Sweatt, come
over and told me they sent a witness over to their office, which was located
diagonally across the street, and said this witness might be able to shed light
on the description of a suspect, so I went to the sheriff's office and I stayed there
for quite some spell talking to witnesses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did you talk to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Several of them. I would have to look up their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, looking at your index in your little notebook, I see you have
something about an Arnold Rowland there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes; I talked to Rowland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do your notes say you talked to Rowland about? What did
Rowland say, according to your notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Said he was standing. I don't know whether he was with his wife
or his girl friend, I don't know what connection, they were standing on Houston
between Main and Elm, approximately 15 minutes before the President arrived.
They saw a man standing back in the background of an open window two floors
from the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Two floors from the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That is what he said. The man appeared to have a rifle with
scope on it in his hand and he noticed another thing that he said about this, he
said the man was standing on the west side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The west side of the south side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What else did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He thought it was a security man, is the reason that he made
no issue of it. I am unable to give a description except a white man, and that
he heard three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say how much of the man he saw, or not; do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I don't remember any further. There was a court
reporter there and so forth, and they took an affidavit of him at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything about seeing any other man in the window
in any other windows there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, did you interview any Ronald Fischer or a Robert
Edwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I got a Ronald Fischer and Bob Edwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you have about them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. They said they saw a white man in his twenties standing on the
fifth floor of the Book Building in the east window. Had on an open-necked
sports shirt and had sandy-colored hair. And said the hair was longer than
a crewcut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What else did they say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That is all the notes I have. Like I said, there was an affidavit
taken from them at the time, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now this is with regards to the&mdash;do you have this under Fischer
or under Edwards, or both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Under both. They were more or less together at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they think they could identify the man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Thought they said they could identify him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever take pictures out for either one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. The one that lives in Mesquite, whichever one that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is Ronald Fischer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Whatever that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Fischer say about the pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He said it could be the man he saw, but he couldn't remember
positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he give you any more identification of the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. None other than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were at the sheriff's office then and took part in the taking
of various affidavits there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I questioned witnesses. I didn't take any of the affidavits, but
they did send court reporters and secretaries up and affidavits was taken from
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember, you yourself, questioning a Howard Leslie
Brennan or anyone questioning a Brennan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Brennan, let me check. I've got a Charles F. Brehan [spelling]
B-r-e-h-a-n, that I talked to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No; that is not the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Probably I didn't. That was probably the name I was thinking
of when you said Brennan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, while you were there, did you learn that an officer
had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I did; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, I stayed down there for quite some time talking to these
witnesses, and then I went back over to the School Book Depository Building
to check and see if my partner was there.</p>

<p>Mr. Senkel hadn't seen him in quite a while and didn't locate him. There was
several officers over there, Special Service, still had the building secured, and
you want this mentioned that coat business in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. The coat has no bearing on the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean in your statement I have with reference to a coat
being found on Industrial Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; as far as I know, that still has no bearing in the case,
but it was placed in the property room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You just found a coat somewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, a Mr. Kaminski from the police department handed me
a coat when I went back over to the building, with a note of who had turned
it into him, where it was found, and he had no idea whether it had any bearing
on the case or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you investigated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. As far as I know, the coat does not have any bearing on the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. After I left there, I went back to the sheriff's office and I talked
to the one lieutenant in our office then and found out that Mr. Senkel had gone
back to our office, so he in turn, he told me I might as well come on up there,
looked like things, about all I could do down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I went to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, when I walked in there, one of the lieutenants was talking
about finding a justice of the peace to obtain a search warrant, and I told
him that I just left the sheriff's office and one of the J.P.'s was down there
when I left, David Johnston, and so he said, "Well, see if you can get ahold
of him and get a warrant for this address on North Beckley and carry the
warrant over there."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that have been 1026 North Beckley?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; I am sure it is. I have to look in the paper here a
minute; 1026 North Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, Detective Moore was in the office. He and I got a car
and drove down by the, back down to the sheriff's office, and when we got there,
Judge Johnston and one of the assistant district attorneys, Bill Alexander,
was standing on the front steps waiting for us, because someone got ahold of
him by phone and told them I was on the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that Detective H.&nbsp;M. Moore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We went on over, the four of us&mdash;me, Detective Moore, Judge
Johnston, and Mr. Alexander&mdash;went over to 1026 North Beckley where this Lee
Oswald had a room in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went over there on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now according to one record that I have of a search warrant, it is
dated November 23. Do you have any particular knowledge whether the search
warrant was actually dated November 22 or November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't remember the date on it, but I know he had the warrant
made out, and handed it to me when I got in the car, but I don't remember
the date on the warrant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We looked through this room and picked up everything in it
that didn't belong with the house, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was W.&nbsp;E. Potts and Bill Senkel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. They were along with Lieutenant Cunningham and the three
were there when we got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We picked up all the articles and brought them to the homicide
and robbery office of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You made out an inventory of them there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am handing you what has been marked "Moore Deposition Exhibit
1," and ask you to state whether this appears to be a copy of an inventory
that you made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I think all of <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Just a <span class="locked">second&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We got stuff out of two or three different places. Here is the
typed-up list of the copies that I made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You made a typed-up list of things that you picked up at 1026
North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are these the things that you picked up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That is the same that was picked up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this a complete list, or might there have been other things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. There is some articles of clothing that is not listed. It is just
listed as miscellaneous clothing and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is your original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; that is a carbon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is a carbon? Who typed the carbon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, the carbon was made at the time the original was made
by one of the secretaries in the&mdash;our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who dictated it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, that is a different thing. She took it out of this notebook,
and Mr. Moore wrote part of it in the notebook and I wrote part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, these are copies [of] notebooks that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let's mark this as an exhibit. Let's mark this as "Turner
Deposition Exhibit 1," which I will offer to introduce in evidence.</p>

<p>Do you need this back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No; I am sure we have other copies. That is a copy I had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
my locker. I mean, that is probably the same. They might have made a more
detailed description of it down at the property room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what did you do after you left the Beckley residence?</p>

<p>Did you talk to the landlady there at all? Or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Talked to her, but I can't recall her name. There was a Mrs.
Johnson and Mr. Johnson and Earlene Roberts. There were two or three people
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything that anyone said at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I don't. Mr. Potts and Senkel and Cunningham were
waiting for us to bring the warrant, so they had been talking to them before
we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember finding a leather gun holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; there was a holster found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. After we brought this stuff to the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, by that time the phones and everything else were going
wild. I answered phones around there for quite a while. I believe I did take
an affidavit from a sister of the boy that worked with Oswald at the Texas
School Book Depository, the boy that he rode to work with that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you do when you take an affidavit, by the way? How
do you go about doing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, I just take the&mdash;let them tell the story, and write it down
in longhand, and get the secretary to type it up, and let them sign it in front
of a notary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have an affidavit in front of you or your notes from this
Linnie Mae Randle, this sister of the boy that drove him to work, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you throw those out once the affidavit is typed up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't believe they ever gave it back to us. I guess the secretary,
she might have filed it somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you did that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. That is the only affidavit I can remember taking in this thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what happened? Anything else on that day that you
think is important insofar as the assassination is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't think of anything. Let me look through these notes
here and see about where we are. As far as that day goes, that is about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Do you remember when you were out at
1026 North Beckley finding a passport at all? Does that ring a bell with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I think there was a passport, maybe one or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not there was any kind of vaccination
card, one of those yellow health organization vaccination cards which
bears the name of Lee Oswald? Do you remember whether there was any of
those there or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't remember whether there was or was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't remember whether there was or was not; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the next day, Saturday, November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Just nothing of importance that I did that day, that I know of,
except I came to work, like I said.</p>

<p>They had to put in four or five extra phones up there, and it kept lots of
us busy answering the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At that time did you ever get involved in any interrogation sessions
with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I never was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever get involved in any showups of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir. I think I might have got right in on the tail end of
one down there, but I don't recall the details. I think I walked in just as they
were winding up on him one night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you receive any phone calls about anyone that tried to identify
the rifle as to where it might have been purchased from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; I did. On one of the phone calls, but I don't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
the man's name that called, but he did state that he had seen a picture. This
was probably Saturday, the next day. He stated that he had seen this picture
somewhere of this rifle, that was found, and he stated this about this Klein's
Sporting Goods of Chicago had an exact replica in a magazine that he had
seen, and I passed that along to Captain Fritz, and he already had the information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything&mdash;any other information come in on Saturday of any
importance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right; were you in the police station Sunday morning, November
24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you come to the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I came in from church, approximately, shortly after 12, and my
mother-in-law or somebody told me they had seen the incident happen, or had
then heard the incident, or told me about the incident, so I called the office
and they said come on to work, so I probably got to work about 1 o'clock or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you stayed down there on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; until in the night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone call in on Sunday about anything of importance with
regard to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir. I mean, I don't know whether it was in regard to the
assassination. They called in about there was supposed to be a man at Irving
that sighted in a rifle out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who it was that called in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; it was Mr. Ray Johns, channel 8 news.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He stated he had received an anonymous call stating Oswald
had the rifle sighted in on Thursday, November 21, at a gunshop at 111 or 212
Irving Boulevard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, I checked the crisscross and phone book and found there
was an Irving Sports Shop at 221 East Irving Boulevard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Found a man that owned it, Woody Greener, and had a man,
Dial Ryder, that worked for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk with either or both of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes; I did. I don't remember that particular time, but I have
talked with both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if it was on that day or a subsequent day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't remember whether it was that day or the next day, I
sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did you talk to? Did you talk to Greener?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I talked to Mr. Greener first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you later talk to Ryder or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; I have talked to Ryder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Greener say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, they said that they had all seen pictures of Oswald in
the paper, and neither of them could recall doing anything&mdash;any work for the
man in the shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What else did he say, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He stated he would check his files and records for names, and
would call back if he found anything and he was giving us a reason there, from
looking at the photos in the picture, why they hadn't worked on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What reason did he give you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, in the photos it showed that the screws that hold the clamp
that holds the scope on the rifle looked like they were on top of the gun, and
he thinks, he says that neither of them have ever seen a gun where the scope
was mounted with the screws on top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they ever talked to again about the thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. About November 28.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did you talk to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Mr. Greener.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He stated that they found a work ticket in the rear of the shop.
Said this ticket had no date on it, but the best they could figure out, his&mdash;this
work probably came in around November the 4th or November the 8th of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, what else did he say about the work ticket that would call
attention to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He said the ticket had the name Oswald on it, written on it,
and the word "drill and tap, $4.50, and bore sighting, $1.50."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not he could remember anything about
this, about the man they did the work for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He stated that he could not; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever talk to Ryder about it, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Ryder say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He couldn't remember either, anything about the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever show them the gun itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I didn't; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not the gun was ever shown to these
men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say who wrote the ticket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. They said that it was Ryder's writing, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Did you ever pick up the work ticket on&mdash;or
try to pick up the work ticket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; I tried to. Went by Mr. Greener's house. He said
that he had orders from a Mr. Horton of the FBI to hold this ticket and not
let it get away from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you contact Greener about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you contact Greener about this, or don't you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what the phrase, "Drill and tap," means, or did you
discuss this with Mr. Greener?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; I did. He explained it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He said the phrase, "Drill and tap," as used by a gunsmith means
to drill a hole, using a tap to put threads in the hole to attach a scope mount.
Said that he charged a $1.50 a hole to bore these holes. Said this would mean
that the mount on this scope would have three screws in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let's see, that would be $4.50. Well, as I understand it, he said
that&mdash;do you know how many screws the rifle had on the top of it that was found
in the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; I don't. I never examined it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But this would indicate three screws on top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. According to his charges of a $1.50 a hole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many on top? I mean, three screws based on his $1.50 a
screw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. A hole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the bore sight? What does that mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. The phrase boresight, his description means to attach to a spud
to the barrel of the rifle, and then using a sight-alining tool, they attach this
spud to this tool and aline the crosshairs, and that is to sight a rifle in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he indicate to you whether or not he knew of any particular
rifle that had three screws on the scope mount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; he named two. He said that most mounting for scopes
was four screws, but he said there are two or three, the Springfield 03AM and
the British 303. He said those two use three screws in their mount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now do you have anywhere in your notes as to whether or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
you put down as to how many screws in a mount this rifle found in the School
Book Depository Building had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right; did he say whether or not he sold any ammunition
for a 6.5 caliber Italian rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He stated he does not sell ammunition for those caliber rifles, 6.5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not he would try and do any further checking
to see if he could determine when the order was picked up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; he said he would check his sales tickets and see if he
could find perhaps by the $6 charge approximately what date it might have been
picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever go back and talk with him later to see whether or
not he did this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. We did, but he wasn't, as far as I can remember, he wasn't able
to do any good. He might have had a lot of charges in that amount or nature
or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any other conversations with him that you recall right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. None that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the other man, Mr. Ryder? Did you ever talk to
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say and what did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Mr. Ryder said that he wrote the work ticket up with the name
Oswald on it. We showed him a picture of Oswald, and he stated that he cannot
identify the man as the one who left the rifle with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say that he was sure that Oswald's picture was not the
man, or did he just say he could not give positive identification one way or the
other, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't recall the exact words, but I know he didn't identify him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What else did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well, he said that, I believe, that this ticket was written up
with a pencil. He said he usually writes with a pen, and he could recall some days
in the past month when he had forgotten his pen or something, and he was
going to check around and see if he could figure out what day the rifle might
have been left there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever do this at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I don't recall whether he did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't have another record of your going back and talking
to him, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know if the FBI did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not he had ever seen any pictures of the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Said he had seen pictures of it, yes, sir; probably in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not those pictures enabled him to determine
that he had or had not worked on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He said from the pictures he had seen of it, he did not think
that he was working on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. He thinks from the photos that the scope mounting had only
two screws in it, and he states that they charged for three on this ticket, and
said that he also thinks that he would remember a cheap scope like was attached
to this rifle, and would have tried to sell the man another one, and would
remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, I believe you said you took a picture of Oswald out
to this Ronald Fischer that lived in Mesquite, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything else that Fischer might have said about
this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir; only that he said the photos of Oswald looked like the
man he saw at the window that shot, and he stated he saw this man a minute
or less before the motorcade arrived, and could not say definitely this was the
man. He said it looked like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Detective Turner, is there anything else you can think of that in
any way bears upon the assassination of the President of the investigation you
made that we haven't discussed here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been sitting here while I put in a call to Washington
to determine whether or not the rifle had two or three holes for screws for the
mounting of the scope, and just so that your curiosity will be relieved, I will say
that I have a report from Washington that there are only two holes for mounting
the scope on this particular rifle. Well, if you have nothing further, we
want to thank you very much for all the cooperation in coming down here.</p>

<p>One other thing on the record. You have the opportunity to read this and
sign it before it goes to Washington, or you can just waive the signature and
have the court reporter ship it. Do you have any preference or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. What have they been doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, most of the officers have been saying they would as soon
read it and sign it, but you can do it either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. I suppose it is all right to just let it go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You want to waive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>. Well.</p>

<h2 id="t227">TESTIMONY OF GUY F. ROSE</h2>

<p>The testimony of Guy F. Rose was taken at 3 p.m., on April 8, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you please hold up your right hand to be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before the
Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, now, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. G.&nbsp;F. Rose, 714 Hall Road, Seagoville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I am a police officer, a detective assigned to the homicide and robbery
bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Ten years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I was born in Grannis, Ark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I finished high school in Grand Prairie High School and attended
grade school at Shady Grove Independent School District between Irving and
Grand Prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what have you done since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, after I finished high school I went to work for a construction
company as a timekeeper and worked until I was 21. Then I went on the
police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have been on the police department ever since you were 21
years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. It was in 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November 1963, were you on duty?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I went on duty shortly after the assassination. At the time of the
assassination I was not on duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did somebody call you and ask you to come on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No; I came in just as soon as I heard of the shooting&mdash;I came on to
work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I reported to the homicide office. It's room 317 at the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. There were some people in the office from the Book Depository and
we talked to a few of them and then in just a few minutes they brought in Lee
Oswald and I talked to him for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you say to him or did he say to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, the first thing I asked him was what his name was and
he told me it was Hidell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you it was Hidell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't tell you it was Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No; he didn't, not right then&mdash;he did later. In a minute&mdash;I found
two cards&mdash;I found a card that said "A. Hidell." And I found another card
that said "Lee Oswald" on it, and I asked him which of the two was his correct
name. He wouldn't tell me at the time, he just said, "You find out." And
then in just a few minutes Captain Fritz came in and he told me to get two
men and go to Irving and search his house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when he first came in there&mdash;you said that he said his name
was "Hidell"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that before you saw the two cards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you saw the cards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he give you his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. He just said "Hidell"; I remember he just gave me the last name
of "Hidell".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you found two or three cards on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you search him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. He had already been searched and someone had his billfold. I
don't know whether it was the patrolman who brought him in that had it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the contents of the billfold supposedly were before you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you sitting down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No; I was standing in the interrogation room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was he&mdash;was he standing too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No; he was sitting in the chair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the handcuffs behind or in front of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I believe they were behind him&mdash;I don't remember for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who else was present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Detective Stovall, he was my partner, and I believe both uniformed
men were present&mdash;two of the uniformed men were present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The ones who brought him in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I don't remember&mdash;I did see McDonald and I did talk to him, but
I don't remember whether he was the one that was standing right there at the
time or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you saw the cards, you asked him which one was his true
name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. He said, "You find out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask him what his address was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; but from there, he wouldn't tell me&mdash;he just said, "You just
find out."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did anybody ever tell you that his address was 1026 North
Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Later they did&mdash;right then they didn't; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't know it at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How soon after that did you go out to Irving&mdash;to the Irving
Street address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. In just a few minutes Captain Fritz came in and he instructed me
to get two men and go to Irving to the Ruth Paine home and so I went
immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you "the Ruth Paine home," or did he tell you to go to
a certain address in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I believe he gave me the address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. 2515 West Fifth in Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many men went out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. There was me, and Detective Adamcik and Detective Stovall, and
on the way, we radioed and asked for a county unit to meet us, and we were met
by Detectives Harry Weatherford, E.&nbsp;W. Walthers, and J.&nbsp;L. Oxford, detectives
for the county CID&mdash;we waited about 40 minutes and they came and met us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have a search warrant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No; we didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get in the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. We walked up to the house, me and Stovall and one of the county
officers, and I could hear the TV was playing, and I could see the door was
standing open&mdash;the front door was&mdash;and I could see two people sitting inside
the living room on the couch, and just as soon as we walked up on the porch,
Ruth Paine came to the door. She apparently recognized us&mdash;she said, "I've
been expecting you all," and we identified ourselves, and she said, "Well, I've
been expecting you to come out. Come right on in."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did she say why she had been expecting you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. She said, "Just as soon as I heard where the shooting happened,
I knew there would be someone out."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took part in the search, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What part did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, I was the senior detective that was there, and so I was sort
of the spokesman for the group, I suppose, and Stovall went into the bedroom
of Marina Oswald&mdash;Marina Oswald's bedroom, and I don't remember where
Adamcik went first, but I talked with Ruth Paine a few minutes and she told
me that Marina was there and that she was Lee Oswald's wife and that she was
a citizen of Russia, and so I called Captain Fritz on the phone and told him what
I had found out there and asked him if there was any special instructions, and
he said, "Well, ask her about her husband, ask her if her husband has a rifle."</p>

<p>I turned and asked Marina, but she didn't seem to understand. She said she
couldn't understand, so Ruth Paine spoke in Russian to her and Ruth Paine also
interpreted for me, and she said that Marina said&mdash;first she said Marina said
"No," and then in a minute Marina said, "Yes, he does have."</p>

<p>So, then I talked to Captain Fritz for a moment and hung up the phone and
I asked Marina if she would show me where his rifle was and Ruth Paine
interpreted and Marina pointed to the garage and she took me to the garage
and she pointed to a blanket that was rolled up and laying on the floor near the
wall of the garage and Ruth Paine said, "Says that that's where his rifle is."</p>

<p>Well, at the time I couldn't tell whether there was one in there or not. It
appeared to be&mdash;it was in sort of an outline of a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the blanket had the outline of a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it tied at one end?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes, sir; it was sort of rolled up, but it was flattened out from
laying down and tied near the middle. I would say, with a cord and so I went
on and picked the blanket up, but it was empty&mdash;it didn't have the rifle in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You brought that in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I didn't make very much of a search of the garage at that time. I
came back into the house and talked with Marina some more and talked with
Ruth Paine some and was busy trying to make arrangements to get someone to
come down and take care of Ruth Paine's children and Marina's children so I
could bring them to the city hall and I did assist Stovall and Adamcik in this
search, briefly&mdash;I didn't do too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could I see the report there, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes&mdash;I wrote that report shortly after the 24th&mdash;I believe it was
around the 24th, but I don't remember for sure what date I wrote it. I wrote
it from some notes that I had taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, after you were there for a little while, did Michael Paine come
in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; we had only been there a few minutes and we were in plain
cars, so I don't know whether he knew we were there. He didn't appear to know
we were there, and he walked up the sidewalk and just walked in the door
without knocking, and I was standing just around the corner talking to Ruth
Paine and she was standing in his view and he didn't see any of the officers&mdash;we
were all out of sight at that time, and he walked in and he said, "I came to
help you. Just as soon as I heard where it happened, I knew you would need
some help."</p>

<p>Then he apparently saw us and then he spoke to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Marina Oswald tell you&mdash;point to the blanket and say something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. She pointed to the blanket and said something in Russian and Ruth
Paine was standing right there beside her and she interpreted for me&mdash;she said,
"That's where her husband's rifle is."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About that time, while you were there, did a Mrs. Linnie Randle
come over to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. She might have come up to the yard and I didn't talk with her&mdash;I
saw her out in the yard&mdash;I didn't talk to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't talk to her at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. At that time I didn't&mdash;I did later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You brought Ruth Paine and Marina down to the police department,
did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; we took Ruth Paine and Marina and Marina's two children in
our car and also the blanket&mdash;I carried it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the rest of that day you spent in inquiring for and looking
around for Wesley Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, we came on back to the city hall and we took Ruth Paine and
Michael Paine and Marina Oswald to the homicide office, but it was so crowded
that we transferred them to the forgery bureau office next door, and then someone
came over and I believe it was the Detective Senkel, to take affidavits from
them and I immediately started trying to locate Wesley Frazier.</p>

<p>We were told that he would be at Parkland Hospital, but we checked through
Parkland and there was no Fraziers there and I started a check of the clinics
and the doctors' offices in Irving, and I located through one of the nurses, I
believe, or talked to someone on the phone there that Mr. Frazier was in the
hospital there at the Irving Clinic, so I called Detective McCabe in Irving and
told him that we wanted to talk with Wesley Frazier and that we understood
that Wesley was the one that had brought Lee Oswald to work that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took a statement from Frazier that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; we got Frazier and brought him in and took a written affidavit
off of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you also talked to Linnie Randle that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; I brought her in, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to Lee Oswald any more during that day except the
time you mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you present at any time that anyone questioned him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Not that day. I was the next day, on Saturday&mdash;I was present when
Captain Fritz talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Saturday morning you went out to Irving again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At this time you had a search warrant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you search on this day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. We made a search of the garage, mainly, on this day since quite a
bit of Lee Oswald's property was in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you find there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, I found two sea bags, three suitcases, and two cardboard boxes
and all of them contained numerous items of property of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you find some pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; I found two negatives first that showed Lee Oswald holding a
rifle in his hand, wearing a pistol at his hip, and right with those negatives I
found a developed picture&mdash;I don't know what you call it, but anyway a picture
that had been developed from the negative of him holding this rifle, and Detective
McCabe was standing there and he found the other picture&mdash;of Oswald holding
the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color were the sea bags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I believe they were kind of an off white&mdash;I would call them&mdash;more
of a greyish-white.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the suitcases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I don't remember the color of those suitcases. I know one of them
was real worn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you brought that property back here into town, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you say you sat in on the interrogation of Oswald later that
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. On Saturday evening&mdash;that Saturday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I don't remember&mdash;it was late&mdash;it seemed like it was around 9 or
10 o'clock, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, Captain Fritz, Detective Sims, and myself&mdash;I don't remember&mdash;there
was an FBI agent and a Secret Service agent there, but I don't
remember their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Do I remember what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That this took place in Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. In Captain Fritz' office&mdash;yes. Well, the occasion was&mdash;I got back to
the office and I took this small picture of Oswald holding the rifle, and left the
rest of them with the Captain and I took one up to the I.D. bureau and had them
to make me an enlargement of it, and they made an almost 8" by 10" enlargement
of this picture and I brought it back to the captain and Oswald was brought
in and the captain showed him this picture, and Oswald apparently got pretty
upset when he saw the picture and at first he said, "Well, that's just a fake,
because somebody has superimposed my face on that picture." Then, the captain
said, "Well, is that your face on the picture?"</p>

<p>And he said, "I won't even admit that. That is not even my face." I remember
that part of it distinctly.</p>

<p>I remember him volunteering some information about when he was in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, he talked about how life was better for the colored people in
Russia than it was in the United States. I don't remember&mdash;he just rambled
on&mdash;he liked to talk about that, but he wouldn't talk about anything to do with
the assassination or the killing of Tippit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever hear anybody accuse him of assassinating the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No, sir; I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever hear anybody accuse him of killing Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No; I don't believe so. Some mention might have been made of the
assassination but I don't believe it was as an accusation to him. That was the
only interrogation I sat in on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the only one you sat in on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember anything else that was said in that interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No, sir; that's about all I can remember. There was more said, but
I don't remember what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take part in any of the search of the premises?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Let's, let's see&mdash;that was Saturday, and then Sunday, immediately
after Oswald was shot, I reported for duty and I was supposed to be off and I
reported on as soon as as he was shot and Captain Fritz told me to get a search
warrant and go out to Jack Ruby's apartment and search it and I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I believe those are all the questions I have to ask you, Mr. Rose,
and this will be written up and submitted to you for your signature, if you want
to read it and sign it, or if you want to, you can waive your signature&mdash;just as
you wish. What do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, I don't know&mdash;will it be later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Well, if she will just call me, I will drop by anytime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay, that will be fine. We will do this. Thanks very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Let's see, there was something else I was going to tell you now, I
wanted to mention&mdash;we did run Wesley Frazier on the polygraph, did you know
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I know you did&mdash;we know about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thanks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Back on the record. Had you ever heard of officers taking part
in showups before in your department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But, you hadn't yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Not that I recall, that has been an awful long time ago. I don't
recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you use your&mdash;use showups in your business, in the vice
squad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I don't think we do; huh-uh, no. Never heard of it done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never have? Who talked to you and asked you to take part
in the first showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he talk to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No; he talked to somebody else in our bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And they relayed the order to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. We went on up to&mdash;Clark and myself went on up to the third
floor of the homicide office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who else was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Several different people. Captain Fritz, a lot of homicide detectives
and Texas Rangers and several other people that I don't know who they
were. I gather law enforcement agencies, but it was, the office <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay. We'll put that on. Now, did you have numbers in the
showup as such? Have a number above each man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; I believe we do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, facing the audience, if you were in the audience, were you
numbered from left to right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Numbered from left to right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; he didn't ask any questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, back to the first showup, did the detective ask you any
questions? Ask your name and address and occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oh, in the showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He asked me my name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I don't remember what I told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you give him your real name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fictitious name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ask you your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Asked my occupation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I don't recall. All of them are fictitious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fictitious?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anything that was said in the audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; I couldn't hear anything that was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Lights were on you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Lights were on us; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you couldn't see in the audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, can you refresh your memory from the police report and tell
me what time that first showup was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. 4:35 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. P.m.? You were in the second showup also, weren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Second showup would be 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, those were the only two showups in which you took part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, at the 6:30 showup, how did you happen to take part in
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I believe some detective, I don't recall who, came up from homicide
and told us that there would probably be another showup after the first
one, to stick around in the event that there was that they wanted us again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you still stick around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you remember what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; they were all fictitious answers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir; none whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever been in a showup before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever heard of officers or employees of the Police Department
being used in a showup before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir; I have. I hadn't until I went to work for the police
department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me, it is your conclusion I know, but tell me briefly what
you learned as to the practice of the police department of using jail employees
or officers in showups? You can generalize. I am not holding you down as to
where you learned it. Tell me what you learned about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Well, only times that I have heard that&mdash;I have never seen a police
officer or employee used in a showup but only times I have heard of them being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
used is when they need somebody in a hurry, or need somebody to do that.
Well, to more or less look like they belong in a showup or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Somebody that looks like the prisoner who is in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you aware when you went in there that you would be asked
certain questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were not? When you went in there where did you stand in
the line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. I was No. 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be facing the audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were aware then that you were No. 4 in this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be you were on the left, on the right, facing the
audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Be on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Left facing the audience, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. My left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your left, facing the audience. The detective there, did he ask
you any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he ask you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. As I recall, he asked me where I was from and what my occupation
was and where I went to high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Where I went to high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ask your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. When he asked where I was from I told him Dallas. I don't
recall what I told him when he asked my occupation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell him you were a jail clerk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Gave him a fictitious occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he asked you where you went to high school, where did you
tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. I believe I told him Dallas. I'm not quite sure on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the name of the detective that asked you the
questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you hear anything from the audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Only time he said anything was when the detective asked him
questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he answer the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you&mdash;you participated in the second showup, too, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. About 6:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in that showup, how were you dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who asked you to go to that showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. The detective in charge of the showup wanted the same members
back in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember who asked you the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. I don't remember his name. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you in that showup? What number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Same position, No. 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was in that showup?</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. It was Perry, Oswald, Clark, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Same ones as in the first showup up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ask you questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. I don't recall on that, on the second showup. I know he did on
the first showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know whether he did or not ask you questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir; not on the second showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If he did ask you questions, he&mdash;you don't recall what they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir; or what I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you take part in another showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. That was later on that evening. I don't recall what time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Think it would be around 7:55, or 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Could have been; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was in that showup with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Myself, Oswald, and two prisoners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Four, again, were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the names of the prisoners?</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have the names here. Richard Walter Borchgardt. Do you know
whether he was there?</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or Ellis Brazel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who asked you to take part in this showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. The same detective that was in charge of the showup said that he
wanted me back in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you been in the jail&mdash;had you been waiting in the jail during
the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Well; I performed my duties in the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In between the showups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you had been on the first and second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were questions asked of you again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. I don't believe it was asked on the third showup. I am quite
sure there was no questions asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you on the third showup? What number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ables</span>. I was in my same position, No. 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. It came on our police intercom radio that we have in the office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Lieutenant Wells was in the office and we asked him if that
was correct, and he said, "Yes, they are on their way to Parkland now."</p>

<p>So he said, "Hurry up and get your prisoner booked and get down there and
help them."</p>

<p>So we immediately put this subject in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. And went to the location of the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. My partner went to the front of the building. I went to the back
of the building, and I proceeded up the back stairs to the sixth floor where I
met Captain Fritz and several other officers on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I talked to Captain Fritz and I asked him what he wanted me
to do. He said for me and Detective B.&nbsp;L. Senkel to gather up&mdash;there was
about five employees there on the sixth floor, with him, and take them to the
city hall and get affidavits from those people, where they were at the time of
the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Where they were at the time of the shooting, and what they were
doing, what they heard or saw during this incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go do that then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You left the sixth floor right then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; Detective Senkel and I took these employees to the city
hall, and in this group of employees I was talking to a Mr. Shelley, and got an
affidavit from him, when the officers brought in Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>And there were several cameramen following these boys also in front of
them, and they opened the door to where I was interviewing; Mr. Shelley looked
up and he said, "Well, that is Oswald. He works for us. He is one of my boys."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do or say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. We got up and got out of the room so they could put Oswald in
there in the room we were using.</p>

<p>We just had two small interview rooms there, and I let them put him in there.</p>

<p>Then as we got outside, of course, the phones were ringing. I answered the
phone. It was Captain Fritz. He was still at the scene on the sixth floor of
the School Book Depository, and I told him that the officers had just brought
in a suspect that had shot the police officer, and told him about Mr. Shelley telling
me that this boy that was identified was Lee Harvey Oswald, was also an
employee there.</p>

<p>He said, "I will be right up in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was Captain Fritz at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. He was still at the scene of the shooting, at the Texas School
Book Depository. He called from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I told him it looked like we might have the boy that was
responsible for that. He said, "Okay, I will be up in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you mean by "that," for the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. For the President's assassination. That was my own personal
opinion at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Then after the confusion died down a little bit, I got Mr. Shelley
back in another room, the other room that was not occupied at this time, and
finished my affidavit with him in regard to what he did, saw, or heard at the
time of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, did Shelley say anything more about Oswald at the time
you talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; after he mentioned that he was an employee there, that
he had been training him&mdash;see, I had taken the affidavit from him in regard to
what he was doing personally&mdash;then after they bring Oswald in, he tells me
that he was responsible for him and was his own personal supervisor. I immediately
got an affidavit from him in conjunction with what his work consisted of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
when he was employed, and what he was doing, and what type work he did there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he indicate where Oswald was, at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No; he did not know where Oswald was at the time of the
shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not he had ever seen Oswald subsequent
to the time of the shooting before he saw him in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; he saw him that morning. He gave him some stuff to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I mean after the time of the shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No; he did not see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say where he, Shelley, was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; I have it in his affidavit. I don't remember where he said
he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But you took an affidavit from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; I did. I don't have that report with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We have a copy of it here, but we are going to take the deposition
of Mr. Shelley and we will get it then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, also, I believe your partner, Mr. Senkel took an affidavit of
Bonnie Ray Williams, is that correct, at that same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That's right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was a Negro employee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you take his affidavit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. He was there employed. He was getting the affidavit from every
employee in the building that day, for the reason of where they were, what they
saw, and what they heard then during this assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you did on that day of November 22, that you
think involved the assassination in any way, shape, or form?</p>

<p>I will ask you this. Detective Brown, you made a memorandum with regard
to your actions on November 22 and November 23, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any memorandum pertaining to any showups that
you participated in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; on the 22d of November I had a showup with my partner,
C.&nbsp;N. Dhority. This occurred in the basement of the city hall with a Mr.
McWatters, who is an employee of the Dallas Transit Co. as a busdriver, who
at that time identified Lee Harvey Oswald as No. 2 in the four-man lineup at
6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Lee Harvey Oswald the No. 2 man in that lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir; he was. That is numbering, facing the stage from your
left to right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean your left, the observers left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; the observers left to his right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do your notes, of their own accord, show who else was in the
lineup besides Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No; it does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where would that information be available?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I am not for sure on that, because during the time we were
taking an affidavit from Mr. McWatters in regard to him seeing Lee Harvey
Oswald on his bus, and also identifying his mark he made on the bus transfer.</p>

<p>Another officer had this stub, and the other three men in the lineup were for
other witnesses to observe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know who else was in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No; I did not get their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what McWatters said when he made his
identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes. Mr. McWatters said, "Yes, he is the one that got on the
bus. I gave him a transfer."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you show Mr. McWatters any transfer that had been found
in Oswald's possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; at the time he was in their office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you yourself show him that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see someone show him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; my partner, Detective Dhority.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did McWatters say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. He said, "That is definitely my mark."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did he seem to identify that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. By taking the slip and placing his punch that he carried. He
did punch a hole in a blank piece of paper that was lying on the desk, and he
held it up for comparison there in our presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, anything else about McWatters at all that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Nothing other than we did take the affidavit and the identification
that he did give us of Oswald in this lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, any other showups on that day or any other day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir. We had showups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. About 7:30, or 7:45 p.m., that same day my partner, C.&nbsp;N.
Dhority and myself had two eye witnesses on the Officer Tippit murder from
400 East 10th Street in our homicide and robbery bureau, and took affidavits
from them of what happened that day in front of their home.</p>

<p>After their affidavits were taken, we took them to the lineup room where
again Oswald and three more men were being shown to other witnesses. Their
names unknown. They were definitely and positively identified by these two.
One was Mrs. Barbara Davis and one Mrs. Barbara Jeannette Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. <span class="locked">Was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Wait a minute, I am sorry. It was Mrs. Virginia Davis, and
Mrs. Barbara Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you there when they made their identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; I was. This was 7:45 p.m., November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did they pick?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. They picked Lee Harvey Oswald again, which was No. 2, in a
four-man lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Lee Harvey Oswald in the four-man lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They identified him as the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Definitely, before they got on the stage, before they got them
under the numbers, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They saw him right away, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; they definitely picked him instantly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Instantly, you have just snapped your hands there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else in connection with that identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That is the only two that I was active insofar as the showups
and identification of Lee Harvey Oswald by any of the witnesses on either
Officer Tippit or the President's assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, is there anything else you had to do with the murder
of Officer Tippit's investigation or the investigation of the assassination that
you haven't related to us thus far today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes. In regard to the Officer Tippit murder, the same date,
November 22, 1963, Lt. T.&nbsp;P. Wells received a telephone call from a Mrs. Barbara
Davis of 400 East 10th stating that her sister-in-law of the same address, her
name as Mrs. Virginia Davis, had found an additional empty .38 caliber shell
cartridge in her front yard.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wells ordered my partner, C.&nbsp;N. Dhority, and I, to go to the
Davis residence where Mrs. Barbara Davis handed my partner this spent hull
at approximately 7 p.m., that evening. That was brought to the homicide and
robbery bureau by myself and Detective Dhority.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it brought to that bureau at the time you brought the two
women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. At the same time the Davis women were brought to the office
for affidavits and identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did you turn that cartridge shell over to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That went to the crime lab, Dallas Crime Lab.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you, yourself, turn it over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No; Detective Dhority handled that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Detective Dhority handled that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. We were keeping this evidence in a chain there. Mrs. Barbara
Jeanette Davis handed him the spent cartridge. He gave it to the crime lab
himself, which was initialled by both of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. None in regard to any evidence or identification of any further
witnesses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else in connection with either the assassination or the
Tippit murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. None that I recall at this time, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir, you have an opportunity to either read the deposition when
it is transcribed and sign it, or else waive the reading and have our court
reporter send it directly to Washington. You can take your choice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, I have no reason to read it for any reason at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to waive signing it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That would be fine. Waive signing, and you can send it right
out. To the best of my knowledge, that is everything that happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we certainly appreciate all of your cooperation and the
cooperation of the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t251">TESTIMONY OF L.&nbsp;C. GRAVES</h2>

<p>Testimony of L.&nbsp;C. Graves was taken at 3:10 p.m., on April 6, 1964, in the office
of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas,
Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you rise and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you state your name, for the reporter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. My name is L.&nbsp;C. Graves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Graves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I am a detective with the police department, city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I am 45 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you born and raised in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes, sir; I was born and raised in Camp County, October 8, 1918.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Leesburg&mdash;I mean to Pittsburg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you get through school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I finished 10½ years of schooling in Pittsburg and Leesburg,
then received a high school diploma after such time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Then what did I do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, let's see. From there I went into the CCC camp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For a period of several years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Let's see, I think a couple of years, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I came out and stayed out about a couple of months and then I
joined the Texas National Guard, and shortly after that it mobilized and I went
into active service, at which time I stayed until I was discharged after the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this an honorable discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were your duties in the Army, say, generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I was in the Infantry, and I was a mess sergeant, and I
cooked principally all the time I was in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were the one we all complained about when the food wasn't
good?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; if you want to put it that way. I got a few complaints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then after your discharge, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. After my discharge, I came to Dallas, I married and went to work
for Interstate Theatres. First went to work for Railway Express Agency here
and worked for a short period of time and then I went to work for Interstate
Theatres.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do for Interstate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Let me retract that. I believe I went to work for S.&nbsp;H. Lynch Co.
first and later changed to Paramount Distributors, and they went broke, and then
I went with Interstate Theatres, and that is where I was working when I went
to work for the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they all related? In other words, when you say Paramount,
was <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No. S.&nbsp;H. Lynch Co. had a cigarette-candy item section of the
company in connection with the beer distributors. Paramount Distributors was
a vending machine company which went out of business, which was a separate
business, didn't have anything to do with the movie industry or picture industry,
so to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do with that aspect of the business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. The Paramount Distributors, I was a bookkeeper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went from there to where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Interstate Theatres.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do for Interstate Theatres?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. They call it an operating engineer, air-conditioning operating
engineer was the title, for it has to do with operating the equipment for the
purpose of air conditioning and refrigeration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of theatres?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then from there you went to the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What year was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. October 31, 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you have been with the Dallas Police Department ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Graves, were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that an off day for you, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you go to work, if at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. About 2 o'clock that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you already heard the news of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, yes. When I came to work, I had already heard. That is
the reason I went to work, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On November 22, 1963, could you state what you did after you
got to the Dallas Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, the first thing that I did was take a statement from, I believe
her name was, Helen Markham.</p>

<p>Let me see; yes, I took a statement from Miss or Mrs. Helen Markham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you happen to see Mrs. Markham or Miss Markham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, of course you have to be there to realize the mass confusion,
but a squad uniform officer had brought this lady in and she was quite hysterical,
and they put her in a little room, just across the hall from our bureau, and notified
the lieutenant that they had her over there, and when I walked in they told
me to go talk to this lady and take an affidavit from her, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say she was quite hysterical. Describe her actions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. She was crying and upset, naturally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was she saying anything at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I don't recall exactly what she was saying&mdash;what most
hysterical women say&mdash;wringing her hands and talking about the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You took an affidavit from her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I held a showup along with Leavelle and the Chief and
Captain Fritz, and I don't remember who else, about a roomful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you state what occurred in that showup? How many
people were in this showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don't remember exactly how many people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean of the men that were actually lined up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don't know. I believe four or five, I think. He was identified
as No. 2 man. Let me see, he was identified as No. 2 man in a four-man lineup,
yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who the people were who were in this particular
lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don't know. Nobody but Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know that Lee Harvey Oswald was No. 2 man in that
lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any recollection or notes which would in any way
give the approximate physical description of the other men in this lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I don't. I was present out in the front with Mrs. Markham,
and I don't remember exactly who talked to the people or men that were on the
stage. It is quite possible that they might have the names of the other people
that were in this lineup, but I don't myself. I don't remember this physical
description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not they were all white men or was
one or more a Negro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. They were all white men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything about their approximate ages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I don't. Let me say this, that it would be very unusual if
we had a showup and asked a certain person or persons to appear in this showup,
if they put anything other than men that fit their approximate size and age in
there with them, and race and color, I might add, because we just don't operate
that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your general mode of operation with regard to showups?
Perhaps you could tell us this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; I sure can. When we want to show a person up, we call
the jail supervisor and tell him what we want and who we want in the showup,
and to put two or three or four other people with him, the approximate age, size,
and so forth.</p>

<p>And they do that for us, and we&mdash;the only contact, the only dealings we have
had with them is talking to them while they are on the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say the approximate age or size, do you specify what
age or size you want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, it is not necessary, because they are looking at the man
that you are bringing down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. So all he has to do is pick them out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So what you mean is the approximate age and size of the particular
person you want included in the showup, or is it of another particular age and
size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. The fact is, if I was showing you, I would tell them to pull you
for a showup and put some other men about your age and size. That is what
it boils down to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, could you tell us what Mrs. or Miss Markham did or said
when this particular showup took place? Were you standing right next to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. About as close as I am to you, which would be approximately
4 or 5 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right; the men walked in, I assume, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was Mrs. Markham at that particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. She was standing in the center of the room, approximately in the
first row of seats near the front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. She was seated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; she was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. She was standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she look through an opening in the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; this is a screen, a nylon screen of some kind. I am sure you
have seen them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. She can see through, as I understand, but the people in the showup
room cannot see the people on the other side of the screen. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Do you remember what she said or did after the men in
the showup came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, she began to cry when he came in. He was next to the last
man that come in in that order. No. 4, 3, 2, 1, and so forth that came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean No. 4 came first, then No. 3 and then No. 2 and then No.
1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did she start crying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. When he walked in, Oswald walked in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean when the No. 2 man walked in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they still walking at the time she started crying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes. As soon as she saw him; yes. He would have to walk as
far as from here to that stand, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be about 6 or 8 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes, sir; roughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. What did she do or say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, of course she said that was the man that she saw, Oswald.
I mean at this particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she ask to have the men turn so that she would see their
profiles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I don't recall if she asked that or not, but that is the normal
procedure that we do that. We turn him profile, right, left, and to the rear, and
back to the front, in that order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything specific that she said at the time that
she made the identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Nothing other than he is the one, No. 2 is the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was anything said by any of the men in the showup that would&mdash;did
they speak any words or say anything at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. If they did, I don't remember what was said. I am reasonably
sure they asked some questions. That is the usual procedure. If they were,
at this point I just don't remember what was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the dress of the people in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; positively not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does your police department ever take any photograph of an
actual showup, I mean, insofar as still shots, to have any written or pictorial
record of the men in the showup, as to what they were wearing or what they
looked like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That was not a policy or an order at this time, but it has been
done, however, in the past.</p>

<p>But for various reasons, as I say, it is not the customary thing, because we
have quite a number of showups that would necessitate a time element there,
sometimes waiting on the proper people to take the picture, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you have any recollection of in connection
with this showup of Mrs. Markham or Miss Markham's identification?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don't remember anything outstanding at this moment; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember about when this took place, this actual showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, let's see if I have it written down here. We put Lee
Oswald in a four-man lineup in the city hall on November 22, 1963, at 4:30 p.m.,
and had Helen Markham view this lineup. She was positive on the identification
of Oswald, and he was the No. 2 man in the four-man lineup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were reading from your notes that you made of your actions
on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you did on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I don't remember anything else except this affidavit of
Mrs. Mary E. Bledsoe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That was on November 23, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am still on November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Have you had any of the reports that we have made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir. I have read them all, but I have to get this down for
the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. You want me to read this verbatim?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir; you can read it verbatim or else you can tell me if
there is anything that you can develop beyond what you have on the written
record that you submitted to your department.</p>

<p>I am very much interested in this, if you can develop anything. If you can't,
then you can just summarize or repeat what you have put down in your written
report.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you read something it triggers your memory and you remember
something that you might not have put down at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Offhand, I don't remember anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, according to your written report, you took Helen Markham
back to her address, to let her out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember in talking with Helen Markham what she said
as to why she happened to be in the vicinity of the Tippit shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I believe she was going to catch a bus. I would have to see her
affidavit to remember that exactly, but I think she was either going home or
coming from work, one or the other, is the reason for her being at that location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you also later interviewed on that day several other people
in connection with the Tippit murder, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I talked to some; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember who these were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That would be Ted Callaway, Sam Guinyard, and Domingo
Benavides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did any of those men come down to a lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. They did come down later, but I didn't have anything to do with
the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do with bringing them down to see a
lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did all the men come down to a lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I think they did. I was told that they did, and I have not seen
anything authentic about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, your report says two of the three men came down to the
city hall and gave affidavits on views of Oswald in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That would be lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From my interpretation here from what we have, Ted Callaway
and Sam Guinyard gave affidavits, but Domingo Benavides did not. Is there
any particular reason that you know of why Benavides did not come down to
give an affidavit or view a lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I wouldn't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Because after this little episode with them, I never saw them or
had any occasion to talk to them any further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember any conversation particularly with Domingo
Benavides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I am going to try and refresh your recollection to see if I
can help you a little bit.</p>

<p>I believe that he was driving a pickup truck at about the time of the Tippit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
shooting, and actually was the first one to place a call over Tippit's radio that
Tippit had been shot. Does this strike a chord in your memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Not to me. He didn't tell me that. Leavelle talked to him
to one side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Oh, I see. You weren't the one he talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. He didn't tell me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But Officer Leavelle would be the one he talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don't remember anything else of any consequence. I had so
many phone calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had a few phone calls to the police station that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Just a few, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about on November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That is the day I took the affidavit of Mrs. Bledsoe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever bring Mrs. Bledsoe down to view the lineup at all,
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I didn't; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any particular reason why you elected not to take
her down, if this was your election? I don't know if it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any particular reason why you didn't bring her down
to view a lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Not that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now she claimed that she had seen Lee Harvey Oswald on a bus
shortly after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not you asked her to come down to
a lineup and she refused to come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I didn't ask her to come down to a lineup herself. I asked
her to come down and give an affidavit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was she actually at the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone else ask&mdash;let me ask you this question. Whose responsibility
would it have been to have a lineup for certain people? Is this
the interviewing officer, or is this the person in charge of the investigation, or
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. In a case like this, it would have to be the person in charge of
the entire investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who would that have been? Insofar as Bledsoe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Insofar as our bureau was concerned, it would have been
Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you can remember on November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Let me refresh my memory here, if I can. I don't know. I don't
remember anything else on the 23d that was outstanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now on November 24&mdash;first, I want to take that part of November
24 up to the time of the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby.
First, did you have any contact or anything to do with the investigation of the
case on November 24, on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; not before he was transferred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the interrogation of Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Nothing except that I was present during the latter part of the
interrogation; part of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you state the circumstances under which you were present?
How you happened to be present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I had been told that we were going to transfer Lee Harvey
Oswald, and we were told to make preparations to do that, so that would necessitate
going into the office where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you find when you went in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I found, of course, Lee Harvey Oswald, Captain Fritz, and
the people that I have named here. The others present were Mr. Holmes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the U.S. Post Office Department, Mr. Kelley from the Secret Service, Agent
Sorrels from the Secret Service, L.&nbsp;D. Montgomery, detective; C.&nbsp;N. Dhority,
J.&nbsp;R. Leavelle; and Chief Curry came in just a few minutes before we started
to move.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you participate in the bringing of Oswald down to be interrogated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At about what time in the morning, was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I think that was around 9:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you stay with him throughout the interrogation, or did you
leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I stayed in the same room near. In the bureau, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This was done in Captain Fritz' office, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you brought Lee Harvey Oswald into Captain Fritz' office at
9:30 a.m., what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I went back out and answered telephones and talked to people
coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you witness any part of the early interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What time did you go back into Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Roughly, about 11:10 or 11:15 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, the original time set for transfer was around 10 a.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. That was my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, let me ask you, has anyone else taken your deposition
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you have already been questioned as to the transfer of Lee
Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is something I don't want to get into. What about the interrogation?
Do you remember any subjects that were covered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I couldn't think of Mr. Kelley's name, the last time,
but he questioned Oswald along the line of his activity in Mexico and in
Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not Oswald admitted that he was
in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I believe he did admit it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what he said about his activities in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I am too vague on that to make any statement on what he said.
I don't remember exactly, so I would rather not say anything. I know that
he did say something, but the best of my knowledge, it sure didn't amount
to a great deal. Very evasive, as every other answer was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything specific, any questions or any statements
that Oswald made about any other subject that was discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, he said that he had been a student of Marxism since he was
14, I believe, and Communist line, and that he, well, one of his last statements
was that the American people would soon forget the President was shot.
Of course he never admitted that he did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he asked in your presence whether or not he did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, yes; he was asked, but of <span class="locked">course&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. He said no, he didn't shoot him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he asked in your presence whether or not he shot Officer
Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he asked in your presence whether or not he owned a
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what his answer was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. He said that he didn't.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he asked in your presence anything about a picture of him
with a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what his statement was with regard to the
picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. He said, "You could superimpose anything you want to with
cameras. It wasn't him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything else, that you remember, about the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he asked anything about the use of an alias?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes; he was, but he denied that, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he asked anything about his having a pistol in his possession
when he was apprehended, or did he make any statements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, he wasn't asked anything about the pistol in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he make any statements about having a lawyer while he
was in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Having a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you brought him in, after you brought him in, which
was around 9:30, how long did you stay there? Through about how many
minutes of interrogation before you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Let's see, from 9:30 until approximately 11:15, somewhere along
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you in the room in which the interrogation occurred
throughout this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, how long were you in the room where he was being interrogated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. About 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were there the first 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; last 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any of the initial questions of the interrogation
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you accompanied Oswald down from his fifth floor jail
cell to Captain Fritz' office to be interrogated, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any conversation with him when you picked him
up at his jail cell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you remember telling him he was going to be brought down
for interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I told him they were going to transfer him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is what you told him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say as to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, he didn't have anything to say. He didn't know what
transfer meant, I don't think. I think he meant from one jail cell to another.
He didn't know that meant going to the county.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you brought him down to Captain Fritz' office, he of course
had been there before, hadn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he have any comments as he walked in the office about being
interrogated or anything of that nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I don't know. He might have said something to the news media,
I don't remember what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald ever
requested that he be provided a lawyer, insofar as your own personal knowledge
is concerned? Did he ever make any such request to you or in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No, no; sure didn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know of your own personal knowledge whether or not
he was ever advised that he had a right to have a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is what I am asking, then, just of your own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; he wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He might have been by someone else, but it wasn't done before
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Might have been by someone else, but not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this as much contact as you had with Oswald? You indicate
you saw him in a showup and you picked him up in a jail cell and you brought
him down to be interrogated on November 24, when you were present during
about 10 minutes, the latter part of this interrogation. Any other contacts with
Oswald apart from these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; not that I had direct contact with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was your impression of him, as far as a person is concerned?
His demeanor, his action, what kind of a person he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, of course I am not a psychiatrist or psychologist, but I
would say he was an eight ball, in my vernacular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. An eight ball in Army vernacular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. In any vernacular. We deal with a lot of people in our business,
as well as we run into all types of people. I would say that he was egotistical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me stop right there. What gave you the impression he was
egotistical?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, I don't know. A person of his nature and cocky attitude,
I don't know exactly how to explain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any specific thing that he did that gave you that impression, that
you can remember at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; not anything in particular. Again, you just have to be
around people. I don't know how to explain how people act to where it means
anything, but I know what it means to me. I have been wrong a few times,
but I have been right most of the time in summing up how people are, their
actions, and so forth, and I would say this boy was a little far out in his belief
about things in general.</p>

<p>And the way he conducted hisself. He is just plain egotistical, that is all.
He don't care about you, me, or anybody else. He is caring about Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Can you think of any specific action or remark of his that might
be an illustration of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I can't offhand, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you described him, you used the phrase "eight ball." You
used "egotistical." Can you use any other adjective that you think would apply
to him as you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. No; I think that pretty well covers it, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he generally quiet, or was he soft spoken, or was he quick
to make remarks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, he was quick to answer and quick to make a remark when
he was spoken to or asked a question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is he what you would categorize as polite in his answers or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Not always polite. He was straightforward and to the point,
and not necessarily polite.</p>

<p>Don't lead me off in a channel of psychiatry, because I am just telling you
my own personal feeling about the man, and I could be wrong, as I said. So
I am not an expert in that field. I am just telling you what I think about the
man, and you take it for what it is worth. As I said, I could be wrong. I have
been wrong before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he attentive as you saw him. I mean, did <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. If you mean&mdash;he is sharp when it comes to talking to the men.
He listened to everything, everybody he saw, and he had an answer by the time
you got through asking him. That would make him attentive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This could be helpful. In other words, if he were asked a question,
did he pause before he answered the question, or did he just shoot an answer
straight back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Just answered right back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there any exceptions to this, that you could remember, or
was this almost invariably the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, that was the case in everything that I heard him say. He
didn't hunt for words, didn't hesitate at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Detective Graves, is there anything else you can think of that
might be relevant to this area of inquiry which involves anything to do with
Lee Harvey Oswald or the investigation of the assassination, or the shooting
of Officer Tippit, that we haven't discussed here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. At this point, I don't recall anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we certainly appreciate your cooperation, doubly so, because
we know you have been down here once before, and I want to tell you that you
have a right, if you would like, to read the transcript of this deposition and
sign it and make any corrections that you wish, or you can just have the reporter
ship it to us directly in Washington, and waive the signing, whatever you want
to do? Do you have any preference at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. Well, if I don't sign it, it won't make any difference anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can waive it if you would like to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. I will waive it. It don't make any difference to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Graves</span>. In the interest of time and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Thanks a lot.</p>

<h2 id="t260">TESTIMONY OF JAMES R. LEAVELLE</h2>

<p>The testimony of James R. Leavelle was taken at 9:30 a.m., on April 7, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission. Robert T. Davis, assistant attorney
general, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Leavelle, will you stand and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>[Witness complying.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will
be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state you name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. James R. Leavelle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. 7703 R-i-l-l-a [spelling], Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And, what is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Detective, Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been on the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Fourteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been in the homicide squad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. A little over 5 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me about where you were born and your education; what you
have done most of your life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, I was born and raised mostly in Red River County in
east Texas and went into service. After leaving the service, coming out of
the service I worked for different companies here in Dallas until I joined the
department in 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The purpose of our inquiry here is to find out facts concerning
the assassination of President Kennedy. That's the general purpose of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took part in the investigation, did you not, as a member of
the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. A minor part you might say. I didn't have much to do with
Oswald, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you talked to some of the witnesses, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I was working 8 to 4 I believe, that month and I had&mdash;when
I heard of the assassination. I had just come into the homicide office with a
Negro boy I had arrested for robbery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whereabouts did you go then after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. We, along with Charlie Brown, went to the building, the Texas
Book Depository, and talked with the inspector there. I asked him if the building
had been secured and he said it was and Captain Fritz was in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that Inspector Sawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; he said they were sending all witnesses to the sheriff's
office and I might go over and check and see what was needed, so I went to
the sheriff's office and found them in a general uproar more or less. They
had several witnesses around and they wanted to take affidavits from them;
however, none of them had started. So, when I walked in, they knew I was a
homicide man and would be indirectly responsible for some of the investigation,
so I talked with Allen Sweatt, chief deputy, and started to set up the procedure
for the taking of the affidavits from the witnesses when several of the&mdash;four,
five or six of the burglary and theft detectives walked in and told me that they
were sent down there to do whatever was needed to be done and asked me what
was needed, so I told them to work with Mr. Sweatt and take those affidavits and
they could do that as well as I and I would go back to the Depository and see
what might further be needed over there. I went to the Depository and had
been there just a short time talking to some of the officers on duty there. I don't
remember who they were at this time and at that time I heard a radio broadcast
of the shooting in Oak Cliff which involved Officer Tippit and I called my office
and found that there was no one to answer the call in Oak Cliff and since everything
was under control there, I felt like some of us should be in Oak Cliff, so
I borrowed a car from Detective Red Edwards of <span class="locked">burglary&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Robert T. Davis enters.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go ahead, Mr. Leavelle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I borrowed an automobile from Detective Red Edwards, A.&nbsp;L.
Edwards, and proceeded to the Oak Cliff area. I went to the scene of the
shooting. They had removed Tippit's body at that time and I talked with the
sergeant and the officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I believe Sergeant Bud Owens was the sergeant there and one
of the uniformed officers was&mdash;I may be in error on this, but I believe it was
Poe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. J.&nbsp;M. Poe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; P-o-e [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that time someone told you some empty .38 caliber hulls had
been picked up. Did Poe tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; I believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he give you the hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; he did not give them to me. I think my instructions to
him were to turn them over to the crime lab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he show them to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I don't think so; he may have but I do not recall. He may
have. He did say that there was an eyewitness to it but he didn't know her
name at the time. So, while I was talking to him was when the call came out
they seen the suspect go into the Texas Theatre, so I proceeded to the Texas
Theatre, but due to the heavy traffic, I didn't get there until after the arrest
was made and they had left, so I returned to the scene and talked with the
officer some more and I believe that he also told me that a man in a carlot
down there had seen Oswald running from the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Poe, I believe. Now, I could be in error on that but someone
told me anyway, <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went back to the police station and took some affidavits from
witnesses, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That's right, I went on to the station at that time and took
affidavits from&mdash;talked with some of the witnesses that they had brought in
there because at the time I didn't realize there was any connection between
Oswald and the shooting of Tippit or the one that they had arrested in the
Texas Theatre for the killing of Tippit and the Presidential assassination. I
thought it was two different things altogether. So, I proceeded back to the
office to work on that end of it, checking with the captain, and they was tied
up with the Presidential assassination, and not until we got there did I realize
some few minutes later on, when talking to some of the people of the Texas
Book Depository, did we realize Oswald could very well be the same one who
assassinated the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did Captain Fritz instruct you to go out and pick up the
witness and come down to a showup, bring her down to a showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; this Helen Markham, the witness, was in such a state
of shock she had been unable to view the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see her the first time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. She was in the emergency room, in the hospital emergency
room, first aid room, whatever you call it in the basement of the city hall, and
I went over and talked with her and kind of got her calmed down where she
thought she could stand to view the lineup, and when she told me that she felt
like she was able to stand it, why, I called the captain and told him that we
were ready for the showup, at which time some of the other officers brought
Oswald down. I took here into the showup room myself and stood with her while
she viewed the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you and Helen Markham the only two in what you call the
showup room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No, Captain Fritz and Chief Curry was in there also and
possibly one or two others; I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How about your partner, C.&nbsp;W. Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not know whether he was there or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any other witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Now Mr. Graves may have been in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any other witnesses in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who picked the men for the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I had nothing to do with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who the men were in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That particular showup they had gotten two of the officers,
I believe, that work in the vice squad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have the names of the people in the showup; No. 1 was Bill
Perry; is he a Dallas Police Department officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No. 3 R.&nbsp;L. <span class="locked">Clark&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He is an officer also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Vice squad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Don Ables is a jail clerk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who picked these men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I do not know who decided that they be in the showup.
Of course, I am sure whoever did was using them, thinking of the security
angle of it more than anything else, rather than getting prisoners down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it unusual to use officers in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; we don't normally do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You usually have other prisoners in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, trustees serving time, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your memory as to how these men were dressed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I think all of them had on just shirts and trousers, I believe.
I don't think there was any coats involved in any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did any have ties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. None had ties or hats on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who conducted the showup questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I probably asked the questions, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Normally, I would not have asked names in this case because
for fear of her remembering the name, so, or might have heard the name, so,
probably asked how old they were, what occupation, anything so they could
speak and let me hear the sound of their voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did any of them say they were police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No, no; the officers gave some other occupation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what did Helen Markham say while she was in the showup
room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, she was very nervous and I do not recall what all she did
say, but she was able to identify Oswald as the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did she tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. She said he was the man that was at the scene she saw do
the shooting over there in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take a statement from her then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I took one from her but I do not remember whether&mdash;just
when I took it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do after that showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, I&mdash;Mr. Graves and I took Helen back home and after
we dropped her off we stopped by this carlot, 501 East Jefferson, and talked
with the manager or owner of that and found out that he was the one that
had seen the man running. He had heard the shots and seen the man running,
from the scene of the shooting and the colored porter there also had heard it,
and they had gone to the scene and they said, each of them said, that they thought
they might be able to identify the man that they saw running; they heard the
shots and they ran outside and saw him running down the sidewalk across the
street from the lot with the gun in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You also talked to Domingo Benavides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. D-o-m-i-n-g-o B-e-n-a-v-i-d-e-s [spelling]. I would think it would be
spelled differently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He was supposed to be Mexican descent but that Benavides
is actually an Italian name, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did you talk to him also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I talked with him but I do not believe we ever took an affidavit
off him that I recall&mdash;may have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Didn't he tell you that he picked up some empty hulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, he told me he picked them up and gave them to the
officer. I remember the officer told me he had gotten the hulls from someone
who gave them to him, and when I talked to Domingo, he said he was the
one picked them up and give them to the officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you bring any of these men downtown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ask <span class="locked">them&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I called later&mdash;Ted Callaway&mdash;bring the others down; however,
I think the Negro porter there, whatever his name is, is the only one he
brought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you told him to bring the others down? Who did you tell
to bring down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. The porter and this Domingo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But he only <span class="locked">brought&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Sam Guinyard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know why Domingo Benavides was never brought down
for the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I think he said he never saw the man actually. I believe he
said later on he did not see the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He testified here he saw the man running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. But he&mdash;either that or he told me he could not recognize him,
one or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have a showup with Callaway and Guinyard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, I do not recall the time but we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to see your notes here; would that refresh your
memory? Here is a report that you made, also. [Papers to witness.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes, at 6:30 p.m. would be right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 6:30 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was in the audience side of the showup this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. As far as I know there wasn't anyone other than Mr. Graves
and myself, and I am not too sure he was there. I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your notes say that Brown and Dhority were with you. Is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, I do not remember; it could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was with the witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Who was with the witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What officer was with the witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, we were with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who talked to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Are you talking about the witnesses or the ones in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; I am talking about the witnesses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Only two witnesses is Callaway and Guinyard and I talked
with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You talked with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who were the men in the showup this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. These notes show that Billy Perry was No. 1; R.&nbsp;L. Clark, No. 2;
and 4, Don Ables; and No. 2, Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I know they were on two different showups, so it is quite
possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who conducted the questions of the men in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I would think I would have been&mdash;the same line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what Ted Callaway said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Not per se; I know they were able to identify Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the substance of what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say "identify"; that doesn't mean much to me because I don't
know what he identified him as.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He said he was the man; he identified him as the man he
saw running from the direction where the shots came from over in the Oak
Cliff area near his carlot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Sam Guinyard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Same thing, practically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take statements from them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I believe I took affidavits from them, according to my notes,
there while we were waiting for them to come down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you also show them a jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; I took them to the fourth floor and asked them to look at
a jacket <span class="locked">which&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit 162. Does that look anything
like the jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. It looks like the jacket that I showed them; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what Callaway said when he saw the jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He said this was definitely the jacket or one exactly like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what Guinyard said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He said it was also the same type jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now then, did you do anything else that day on this investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not recall other than possibly answer the telephone in
the office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to work at what time Saturday morning, November 23,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. It would be around 8 o'clock, I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you take some statements that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Chances are I may have, I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. It says took one affidavit from R.&nbsp;S. Truly, supervisor of Texas
School Book and the other of employee, Mrs. R.&nbsp;A. Reid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are refreshing your memory from a report that you made, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you attend another showup that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; we held another showup that day which involved a
<span class="locked">cabdriver&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What's his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. We later found out he was near the scene of the shooting and
saw the shooting, also, W.&nbsp;W. Scoggins. We held a showup for him at 2:15 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was anyone else with him at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; there was another man who was another cabdriver, name
of William Wayne Whaley [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I had not talked to Whaley; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What officer talked to Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pick up Whaley in the squadcar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pick up Scoggins in the squadcar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you first see Whaley and Scoggins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. They came to the office, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down with them to the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I am sure that I did. I do not recall but I am sure I must have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here's some other notes that you might look at to refresh your
memory [notes to witness].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. From these notes here it indicates I was there along with them
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your memory? Is your memory different from the notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not remember who else was there, if anyone was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know that you were there with Scoggins and Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember the men in the showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not recall who was in there. I know it says who was
here but I could not tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pick those men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; not at anytime did I have anything to do with picking
the men in any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This was your third showup in the course of your investigation
of the murder of Tippit and the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; the third and the only three I had anything to do with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who conducted this showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I would have handled the speech of that also; asking them
to say a few words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How were these men dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That I do not recall either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember whether they had coats on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I know in all cases we usually try to have them dressed as
alike as possible, the same as each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your memory of this incident? Were they dressed anywhere
near similar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. In one instance&mdash;now, I am not positive which one it was,
Oswald was in a T-shirt, having the other shirt removed upstairs where they
were going to send it to the FBI laboratory for tests, and the rest of them, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
believe, had on shirts. He was the only one that had on a T-shirt and I
recall&mdash;I am not sure but I think it was the last one where he was raising cain
about being up there with a T-shirt and wouldn't be quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He said it wasn't fair, him being showed up in a T-shirt and
being photographed in a T-shirt and all that. I don't know what he didn't say;
he went on all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Whaley say anything to you personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. To me personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, of course. I asked him if he&mdash;if the man that he remembered
or saw there, whatever he was identifying him for there was up there
and he said "Yes, the man in the T-shirt." Whether he was doing all the talking
or not wouldn't make any difference, he still knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Scoggins say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He said practically the same thing&mdash;the man in the T-shirt
was the&mdash;or the No. 3 man was the man he had saw do the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. That would have been Scoggins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Whaley say&mdash;tell you whether or not he had ever seen this
man before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He was supposed to have seen him I believe, but I do not recall
what the circumstances were under which he saw him right offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where Scoggins saw him you remember, in other words, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; in other words, he was the one who said he was sitting
there eating a sack of lunch parked near the corner when the shooting occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on November 24, on Sunday morning, did you return to work
about the same time, 8 o'clock, or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Little before 10, I believe, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And, were you ordered by Captain Fritz to get Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; I don't&mdash;I see here it says 9:30&mdash;whatever the official
time was, I think it probably was maybe about that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go to get Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I had to go to the fourth floor jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you handcuff him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were his handcuffs in the front or in the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. In front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you taking him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Took him down the inside elevator to the third floor into
Captain Fritz's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was present at that meeting in Captain Fritz's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, I can recall, I believe during that time I was there
there were several people in and out. I believe primarily myself and Mr.
Graves and Dhority and Montgomery were in there most of the time, I don't
know. We were in, probably might have stepped outside the door at one time
or another but primarily we were around and also Mr. Kelley, Secret Service,
and a man from the postal inspector's office. I cannot recall his name at this
time. He should be on here&mdash;oh, yes, Mr. Sorrels, also, and Holmes of the
postal department. Now, those people and Chief Curry came in once or twice.
All those people may not have stayed in there constantly during the time but
they were in there at some time or other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did these various people ask questions of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I know Mr. Sorrels did and I know Mr. Kelley did. I do not
recall whether Mr. Holmes asked any questions or not and Captain Fritz asked
him some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what Mr. Sorrels asked him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Remember what Mr. Kelley asked him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I can only remember one question Mr. Kelley asked him and
that was whether or not he thought the attitude of the U.S. Government toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Cuba would be changed since the President has been assassinated. To my
knowledge, that is the only one I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Oswald say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Oswald turned and asked Captain Fritz, said "I am filed on
for the President's murder, is that right?" And, Captain Fritz told him yes,
and he told Mr. Kelley, he said "Under the circumstances, I don't believe that
it would be proper." That might not be the words he used, but wouldn't be
right, anyway, for him to answer that question because whatever he said might
be construed in a different light than what he actually meant it to be, but
he went on to say he felt like when the head of any government died or was
killed, whatever, there was always a second in command who would take over
and he said in this particular instance it would he Johnson. He said "So far
as I know, Johnson's views and President Kennedy's views are the same", so,
he would see no particular difference in the attitude of the U.S. Government
toward Cuba. That's about the main&mdash;the only one, because he went into
such detail on it, the only one I thought was a little elaborate for him to go into
that type of answer, the reason I remembered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember any question Captain Fritz asked him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I remember that the captain asked him about the shooting
of the President and the shooting of the officer; I know he did ask him that and
I know Oswald did deny it, both times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That he had shot President Kennedy and Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; he denied shooting either one. He did say this "If you
want me to 'cop' out to hitting or pleading guilty to hitting a cop in the mouth
when I was arrested", he said "Yeah, I plead guilty to that" but he&mdash;I do know
that he denied the shooting of both the President and Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In that meeting did he ask for a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I know Captain Fritz asked him if at one time, if&mdash;he
handed him a telegram&mdash;in fact. I believe it was sent by some attorney, if my
memory serves me right, and he said he did not particularly want him but he
would take that and if he didn't do any better he would contact him at a later
time. I do not recall what lawyer it was. It seems like some lawyer in the
East sent the telegram volunteering his services to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is there on Sunday morning, the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the course of this meeting which you have been <span class="locked">describing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Oswald say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. He said that he preferred&mdash;he never had gotten in touch
with this lawyer in New York City that represented the American Civil Liberties
Union and he wanted to get in touch with him and said if he didn't do any
better, or could not get him, he would like to talk with this man about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you remember any other questions asked Oswald by Captain
Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No, not offhand; I would probably remember them if I heard
the questions but I do not remember offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody talk to him about the post office box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; Mr. Kelley asked him several questions and probably Mr.
Sorrels about the post office box, both here and one he had in Shreveport&mdash;wherever
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. New Orleans, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what Oswald said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Since you mentioned it, I do remember them talking to him
about the New Orleans box and asking him about this other name, <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Alek Hidell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; and he asked him if he knew Alek Hidell; said he
didn't know if he ever heard of the name. He never heard of that and asked him
several questions along that line and then after he had denied all knowledge of
Alek Hidell, Mr. Kelley asked him, said "Well, isn't it a fact when you were
arrested you had an identification card with his name on it in your possession."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
He kind of grunted, said "Yes, that's right" and he said "How do you explain
that?" And, as best my knowledge, he said "I don't explain it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anybody ask him about a gun, whether or not he bought a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I am sure they did. I remember some of them asking about
the rifle and about it bring sent to the box here in Dallas but I do not recall.
I am not sure he denied it but I do not recall what his exact denial was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say he denied it. Do you remember whether or not he denied
that he had bought a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. To the best of my knowledge I do. He did deny it but I would
not swear to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was anything said about a revolver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I am sure they asked him something about the revolver, too,
but I do not recall what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say whether or not he had a revolver in his possession at
the time of his arrest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not recall what the questions was along that line or even
what the answers was. Like I say, I am sure that they did. It seems as though
my memory tells me that he did not deny taking the revolver but there, again.
I would not want to say definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make any notes of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I did not myself. That was the only time I ever sat in on
the interrogations of him by Captain Fritz or anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the first time you had seen Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I had seen him, of course, the first day he was arrested
and when they brought him in and out of the office taking him to and from the
jail and, of course, I had saw him at the showups, what-have-you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever talked to him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; I had never talked to him before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have any marks on his face when you first saw him on
Friday, the 22nd of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, no; not that I recall. He&mdash;I know he had a black eye.
I remember seeing that some time along the way but I do not recall when I
first noticed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to Oswald about his black eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever hear him say anything to anyone as to how he
received the black eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; I remember at one time when they were moving him. Of
course, if you saw television that day, I am sure you saw what men we had
in the hallway up there with the photographers and newsmen, all were sticking
microphones out at arms' length and hollering questions at him, and at one
time someone asked him how he got the black eye. He said "A cop hit me," but
that was just a hollered response to some unknown question or unknown news-reporter
asking him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you would move Oswald through the halls on the third floor
from one room to <span class="locked">another&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Actually, it wasn't from one room to the other; it would be
from our office to the elevator which is some 20 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On those occasions would the hallway he crowded with reporters,
newsmen, and television cameramen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; cameramen and television men all over the place; in
fact, I was plumb up to my chin with those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, I was disgusted with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would they not cooperate with your request to stand in a particular
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No; if you ever slopped hogs and throw down a pail of slop
and saw them rush after it you would understand what that was like up
there&mdash;about the same situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I'm through. Do you have some more questions, Mr. Stern?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. There was just no response. You asked them to cooperate with
you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Oh, yes; they would be asked to stand back and stay back
but wouldn't do much good, and they would push forward and you had to hold
them off physically. Of course, I realize I am not running the police department
but if I had been running it wouldn't have been nobody up there; like
I say, I was fed up. Fact of the business, one time when I was trying to escort
some witness out of there&mdash;I don't recall who it was at this time&mdash;but I was
trying to get them through that crowd and taking them down the edge of the
corridor and I stopped and I looked down and there was a joker had a camera
stuck between my legs taking pictures so that's just some indication of how
they acted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was any consideration given to clearing the corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. A lot of consideration was given to it by me but, of course,
I didn't have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was it discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I imagine just among the men up there. The officers working
in the bureau probably did. I don't know whether it was discussed on a higher
level or not. I have no knowledge of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. There were actually television cameras in the corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Hand cameras or the large?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. They had the big camera set on a tripod right at the entrance
of that hallway leading up there which would give them a full view of the
entire hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was your impression of Oswald and the way he handled
himself throughout this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Like I say, the only time that I had any connections with
Oswald was this Sunday morning. I never had occasion of hearing him being
interrogated or had occasion to talk with him at anytime and, to my listening
to him answering the questions that were propounded to him that particular
morning, he gave me the impression of being a man with a lot better education
than his formal education indicated. In other words, for instance the long
elaboration that he went into on the Cuba deal would tell&mdash;indicate that he
had a fairly better than high school education that he was reported to have had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he seem to be in control of himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Oh, yes; he was in control of himself at all times. In fact,
he struck me as a man who enjoyed the situation immensely and was enjoying
the publicity and everything was coming his way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. He engaged in banter with you and the police officials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Not with me because I didn't have occasion to question him,
but he did always smile and never hesitated for an answer, always had an
answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How about on the occasions you were bringing him to or from
the interrogations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I did not indulge in any of that other than the one time and,
of course, if I made any comments to him at that time, I do not remember
what they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How about comments he made to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I know&mdash;I think possibly at one time he&mdash;that morning that
I was bringing him down on Sunday morning that he may have asked me
where he was going or if he was going back to Captain Fritz' office that morning,
but aside from that, I do not recall anything else that he may have said
or anything that I may have said to him in the course of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall any complaints that he registered, any statements
he made about his treatment, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. No. I don't think he made any to us that morning we were
moving him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you receive the telegram that arrived Sunday morning or
that was there Sunday morning about the offer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I had occasion to see it. I do not recall what it was. I think
it is a matter of record somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It was there at the Sunday morning interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Yes; it was there and, in fact, I know the captain and I talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
about it there a minute before I went up and got him, talked about informing
him of this lawyer's request or offer. I said "Why not let him have the telegram,
show him the telegram, let him read it himself," so, that's what the
captain done&mdash;let him have the telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall whether any of the witnesses at the showups at
which you were present said that they had seen Oswald on television before
they got to the police headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. Well, I think it would have been impossible for anybody, any
of them to see him with the exception of the two bus&mdash;cabdrivers. Now, the
others may have, I don't recall, but the others all came down on the day of
the assassination so I don't believe that they would have, but I know Helen
Markham would not have because she was taken directly to city hall and had
been there ever since it happened, so she would not, and I do not believe Mr.
Callaway and the Negro porter, Sam Guinyard, would have had an opportunity,
either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In any event, you do not recall it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I do not recall, but I am not saying it would not have happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That's all I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have Officer Leavelle's reports on the officer's
duties filed as an exhibit to this deposition. It is marked "Pages 216, 217, 218,
219, 220." It is a part of the formal report of the Dallas Police Department
concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and Officer Leavelle, your
testimony will be written up by the shorthand reporter and will be submitted
to you if you wish for you to read it and sign it, or, if you wish, you can
waive your signature and it will be written up and forwarded to the Commission
without your signature. How will you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. I see no reason for me to sign it as long as it comes out like
I put it down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If you have confidence in the reporter you can waive signature
and we will send it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leavelle</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is pages 216 through 220 of the formal report which is included
in this Exhibit A. Thank you very much, Mr. Leavelle.</p>

the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Little over 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be in 1947 or 1946?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you been with them ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Two children, boy and a girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What time did you go on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I came at 7 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was your shift from 7 a.m., <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you leave at 3 p.m., on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you first learned of the assassination or the shooting of the
President, where were you and what were you doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I was in Dr. Bledsoe's office just finishing a dental appointment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I immediately drove to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At about what time did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Shortly after the President was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had your appointment over the noon hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after you got to the Dallas Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I asked the captain did he want me to go to the scene or to stand
by until we freed the two men that were at the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. At the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say the scene, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The scene of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they in a building there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who those men were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Detective R.&nbsp;L. Studebaker and Lt. J.&nbsp;C. Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say two men, you mean from the crime laboratory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Two men from our crime scene search section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were you advised to do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I was told to standby until further notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was the next thing that occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Officer Tippit was shot at 10th and Patton in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I immediately went to the scene of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The first thing that I did was to check the right side of Tippit's
car for fingerprints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you find any fingerprints on the right side of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. There was several smear prints. None of value.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were these smear prints located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Just below the top part of the door, and also on the right front
fender.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you happen to check that particular portion of the vehicle
for fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I was told that the suspect which shot Tippit had come up to the
right side of the car, and there was a possibility that he might have placed
his hands on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you do anything else at all out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I photographed the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you had much experience in photography?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I have been in the crime scene search section doing this work
since August 1, 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you photographed the scene, did you use flashbulb equipment
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I assume that because many crime scenes are inside, that you are
also familiar with the operation of flash equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We use flash equipment on the inside and outside when I think
it is necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of camera do you use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Speedgraphic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that the kind of camera that newspaper cameramen often use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. A lot of them do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you did out at the crime scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I photographed the scene; yes. There was a couple of hulls that
was turned over to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you mean empty shell casings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Empty .38 caliber hulls was turned over to me at the scene by
patrolman&mdash;I believe I would be safe in saying Poe, but I am not sure about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. P-o-e, I believe is the way he spells it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You think he was the one that turned over some shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I believe it is. I am not too sure right now, but I believe that
is what is on the report. I would have to check it to be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would these be on your report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would be on our report, at the crime scene search section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that was turned over to you at the scene
besides these hulls that you think Patrolman Poe turned over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Not that I can remember at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. While you were out there, were any additional hulls found other
than these two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes. Captain Doughty picked up another hull, .38 caliber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see Captain Doughty pick it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you advised as to anyone who might have pointed it out
to Captain Doughty, or did he get it himself, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I heard that someone pointed it out to him and he picked it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean some citizen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Some citizen pointed it out to him, and he picked it up?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where he might have located it? What approximate
location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I was a busy man and I didn't watch his operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Not that I can recall at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you took pictures of the Tippit vehicle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of the Tippit police car. You took pictures of that out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take any pictures of anything on the street in the immediate
vicinity of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I took a picture of a stop sign that was located down at the
intersection of Patton and 10th. We had a report that we thought maybe that
might have had some significance on the case.</p>

<p>I also took shots at the rear of the car on the parking lot where a jacket was
discarded by the suspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. In the alley between Patton and the next street over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The next street to the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Between Patton and the alley that ran between the two. I would
have to check on the map. Cumberland&mdash;you got a street map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I have a map here which, if you will excuse me for a moment, I
will try and get.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I sure will. Crawford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We now have a map of Dallas, and you say that the jacket was
found in the alley between Patton and Crawford? Where with relation to 10th
or Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would be between Jefferson and 10th in the alley that separates
those two streets, and running from Patton and Crawford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say running from Patton and Crawford. You mean parallel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It runs parallel to Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Parallel to Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Between Patton and Crawford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Between Patton and Crawford. Was there a Texaco station
around there at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. There is a service station right south of it. The kind of station
that it is, I don't recall the kind of station it was, but there is a service station,
and sort of a parking lot where this jacket was discarded. We got photos of this
car where the jacket was found just behind it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you took some pictures out there, you say, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I did.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record for selection of pictures.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant Barnes, I am going to hand you some pictures which we
will mark as "Barnes Deposition Exhibits A, B, C, D, and E" on the deposition
of Barnes, and I am going to ask you to state whether or not the original negatives
from which these prints were made were taken by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. They were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now the first one, Barnes Deposition Exhibit A, is a picture of
the Dallas Police squadcar No. 10. Was that the Tippit automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when did you say you got out to the Tippit scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Approximately 1:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 1:40 in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Approximately, November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When would you have started taking these pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Within 5 or 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I notice on the right-front door window it appears that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
vent window was open and that the main window is closed. Is that the way
that you found the car when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Inside the window there appears to be some kind of paper or document.
Do you remember what that is at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is a board, a clipboard that is installed on the dash of all
squad cars for the officers to take notes on and to keep their wanted persons
names on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there any notes on there that you saw that had been made
on this clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; we never read his clipboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the way you saw the clipboard there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is the way it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It appears to be there is a picture of some man on the clipboard.
Did you notice whether or not there was any handwriting or any memorandum
paper on the board?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I couldn't tell you what was on the clipboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about this particular picture, Barnes Deposition
Exhibit A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything that you can tell us about it that you think might be
relevant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Not that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am now turning to Barnes Deposition Exhibit B. What is
Exhibit B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is a picture showing the front of the squadcar, and also
blood on the street where Tippit fell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if you could circle with this ballpoint pen on Barnes
Deposition Exhibit B, the spot of blood where you say Tippit fell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. (Circles.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have circled that in ink. Now going back to Barnes Deposition
Exhibit A: earlier, Sergeant Barnes, you said that you tried to get some
prints and you found some smears on the right side of the car. I wonder if on
Barnes Deposition Exhibit A with a red pencil you could show us the general
area where you found the smears?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. [Marks with red pencil on photo.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You put on this print a relatively horizontal line on the right front
car door immediately below the bottom part of the window, and also what I
will call the right part of the top of the right-front fender near where the
headlight is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this police car dirty or clean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Dirty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not this in any way affects your
ability to lift fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Any dirty surface will create a hardship as far as lifting a latent
print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you able to find any identifiable prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No legible prints were found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you came to the scene, Officer Tippit had already been
removed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else on Barnes Deposition Exhibit B that you think is
relevant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None that I can recall at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Turning to Barnes Deposition Exhibit C, could you state what
this is, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is a picture of squad car No. 10, which was driven by
Tippit, a more distant shot showing where Tippit fell, and the scene where
the squad car was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had the Tippit car been moved at any time during the taking
of any of these pictures by you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything particularly relevant about Barnes Deposition Exhibit
C that you want to further discuss at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you Barnes Deposition Exhibit D, will you state what
this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is a side view of the Tippit car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is looking toward the driver's side, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You see the houses in the background which would be roughly
to the south, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is a picture of the car as you found it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, do you remember whether or not the window on the
driver's side was up or down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I believe it was down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was any jacket of any kind hanging in the back of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; Tippit's Eisenhower jacket, that's what we call them, was
hanging on a hanger in the back of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you Barnes Deposition Exhibit E, would you state what
this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. This is a shot from the south looking northward at the front
of the Tippit car, and showing the blood shot on the pavement where Tippit
fell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This has a caption on it, "Spot where Patrolman Tippit fell."
Does the arrow point to the spot to which you refer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else particularly relevant about Barnes Deposition
Exhibit E that you want to discuss now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No. I made that one [pointing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are now referring to Barnes Deposition Exhibit F, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is that a picture of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That shows the rear of the Tippit car, left rear, and also a
view looking to the east, which covers the spot where Tippit fell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At this time we introduce in evidence Barnes Deposition Exhibits
A, B, C, D, E, and F, and I will just have these copies with the original
copy of the deposition for madam reporter. We won't ask you to make copies
of these.</p>

<p>Now you mentioned out there that some cartridge cases were found, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant, I will ask you to examine Commission Exhibits Nos.
Q-74, Q-75, Q-76, and Q-77, and ask you to state whether or not there appears
to be any identification marks on any of these exhibits that appear to
show that they were examined or identified by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I placed "B", the best that I could, inside of the hull of Exhibit
74&mdash;I believe it was Q-74 and Q-75, as you have them identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now all four of these exhibits appear to be cartridge case hulls,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. .38 caliber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. .38 caliber pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They are kind of silver or chrome or grey in color? You can
identify it that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many of these hulls, to the best of your recollection, did
you identify out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I believe that the patrolman gave me two, and Captain Doughty
received the third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The two that the patrolman gave you were the ones that you put
this identification mark on the inside of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What instrument did you use to place this mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I used a diamond point pen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You put it on Q-74 and Q-75?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It looks like there are others that put their markings in there
too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do with identifying either the slugs
that were eventually removed from Officer Tippit's body, or the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You never put any identifying marks on those. Is there anything
else that you did out at the crime scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We made a crime sketch of the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You made a crime sketch of the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; not that I can recall at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do with those cartridge case hulls, Q-74 and
Q-75?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We placed them in our evidence room, and turned them over
to the FBI. I believe Special Agent Drain of the FBI was the agent that took
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you can think of that might be relevant
with regard to your work at the Tippit scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None. Not at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, when did leave there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I don't know the exact hour that I left there, that I got
through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I went on a major accident at Veterans Drive and Ledbetter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Back to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you make any other pictures that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you make any pictures with regard to the investigation of
the President's assassination or the murder of Officer Tippit at any other time
on either Saturday the 23d or Sunday the 24th up to the time of the shooting
of Oswald by Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you make any pictures of the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you do those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I did that the afternoon of November 22, as soon as I finished
with the Tippit car pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you include that as part of the Tippit investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; that was in the same part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me backtrack a minute. You may have misunderstood my
question. When you finished up at East 10th and Patton Streets, you took
pictures, you got shells, you said you tried to get fingerprints. Did you try to
do anything else at East 10th and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then where did you go from East 10th and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before you got to the Texas Theatre, did you stop at the spot
where you say this jacket was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take a picture there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, did you take any other pictures between East 10th and
Patton and the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I took two photos of the place where the jacket was found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But other than that, you then went to the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At the time you got to the Texas Theatre, had Oswald or the
person that was apprehended there already been taken away from the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I photographed the interior of the theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular position of it that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The lobby and the place where the arrest was made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was after that that you then went to investigate that major
automobile accident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now after you investigated or took pictures at this major automobile
accident, then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I returned to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you returned to the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We started working out the evidence and developing negatives
of all the photos that were taken at the Kennedy assassination site and also
at the Tippit site.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who were you working with at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We had just about all the manpower of the crime scene search
section working.</p>

<p>Lt. J.&nbsp;C. Day, myself, Detective R.&nbsp;L. Studebaker, Detective J.&nbsp;B. Hicks, and
Detective R.&nbsp;W. Livingston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you know about what time of the day you were doing this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We started on it, I would say, roughly after I returned to the
city hall. It was getting close to 4 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was this work done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. In the crime scene search section of the identification bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what floor is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It is on the fourth floor of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the fourth floor, were there any people other than police
personnel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Not where we were; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got there, did you see what the situation was on the
third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; we could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was the situation on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Turmoil of news media, photographers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean by turmoil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Well, they just all of them trying to get up in there where they
could get a shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By a shot, you mean a picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; a photo. Any photos they might get for the newspapers.</p>

<p>In case they should get a view, they wanted to be there at the time. I presume
that is what they were there for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Oswald on the third floor at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they have wires coming through the windows for television
cameras, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. There was wires running all over the city hall; cables.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Cables?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about stands for lights, were they there, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That's right, they come up with lights and also TV cameras to
cover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say city hall, really the third floor that we are talking
about is exclusively used by the police department, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, do you have any estimate of the number of newspaper
people there were on the third floor at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would be a guess. I wouldn't want to venture to guess, because
it would be just strictly guesswork.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. More than 20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. More than 50?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I am not saying. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, in any event, you were working on the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Later we went to the third floor, to the office of Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you go to Captain Fritz' office for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. To make a paraffin test of Lee Harvey Oswald's hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when would this have been, approximately, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I tell you, the time didn't mean anything there, and it was after
I returned to the city hall, and after 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometime after 6 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Captain Fritz call you up and tell you to come down and make
the paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. He didn't talk to me. I was advised to go to that office to help
make the paraffin test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By your supervisor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who would that have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Lt. J.&nbsp;C. Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now is this the usual procedure when you are going to make a
paraffin test, to go to an office such as Captain Fritz' office to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What would the usual procedure be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. If he is alive, they usually bring them to our bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be to bring them up to the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This would have necessitated, I would assume, moving the prisoner
from Captain Fritz' office through the hallway up to the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there any people in the hallways at this time, or did anyone
tell you why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is, tell you why they were going to make a paraffin test down
in Captain Fritz' office rather than in your laboratory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No, sir; nobody said anything to me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any particular problem that you saw insofar as taking
the prisoner up to your office from Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; you would have to take him through the throng of newspapermen
and photographers who were in the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether this might have presented a security
problem in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What equipment did you take down to make this paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I took paraffin, the paraffin kit that we have which consists of
gauze and paraphernalia that we need to make the test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this your permanent equipment or your portable equipment?
When I say your permanent, I mean your inplace equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It is the same equipment we use up in our bureau, working under
makeshift conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you use the phrase "makeshift <span class="locked">conditions"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Just like putting up a portable camping ground to cook on. We
have our benches to work on up at the crime scene search section which makes
it handier to work with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would the quality of the test be the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; I think so. The quality would be the same, just takes
a little more time and inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got down there, what did you do and see? First of all,
who was in the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Detective Dhority and Detective Leavelle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that L-e-a-v-e-l-l-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Right. And Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any discussion, or did you hear Lee Harvey Oswald
say anything or anyone say anything to Lee Harvey Oswald while you were
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We got our equipment and got the paraffin melted, and while it
was being prepared, we told him that we would have to make a paraffin cast of
his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It was okay with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything as to any other comments he had about the
paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None other than he stated to me, "What are you trying to do,
prove that I fired a gun?"</p>

<p>And I said, "I am not trying to prove that you fired a gun. We have the test
to make, and the chemical people at the laboratory, at the city-county laboratory
will determine the rest of it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the purpose of a paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The purpose is to find out if there is any nitrates on your hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer, how many years have you personally made paraffin tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Since 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the procedure by which you determine whether or not
there are any nitrates on one's hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The analyses are made at Parkland Hospital by their personnel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do they analyze the wax?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. They analyze the wax that I remove from his hands after the
casts are made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, if you were to take a paraffin or make a paraffin test on one
of my hands, you would take melted hot wax and put it over my hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It wouldn't be hot wax. It would have to be at a degree where
it would be melted. Take a paint brush, small paint brush, dip it into the
paraffin, and paint your hand as you would be painting a wall, and you build
this paraffin up around and around your hand, front and back, until you get
a layer approximately a quarter of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Then you wrap the hands in gauze, just a layer of gauze around it for reenforcement
purposes such as you would put steel and concrete to reenforce it,
and then on top of this gauze we put another layer of paraffin. In fact, several
layers of paraffin on top of the gauze to round it out to make it more firm so
that when we remove this paraffin from around his hands, we take a pair of
surgical scissors and cut down each side, and it slips off just like you were
removing a glove.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You would make two cuts then, one along the side of the little
finger and one along the side of the thumb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Well, really it is a <b>V</b>-cut on the thumb and forefinger, and a
straight parallel line down the left- or right-little finger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the side of the palm of the hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you done any reading as to what this test shows and what
its limitations are at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Well, yes; the purpose of it is when you put the heated paraffin
on the hand, for the nitrates which might be on the hand, to be stuck to the
paraffin that you place on there.</p>

<p>This paraffin that you place on the hand&mdash;I will rephrase this a little bit.</p>

<p>When you put the paraffin on your hand, the nitrates that might be on your
hands will stick to the paraffin as it cools, and when you remove the paraffin,
then this nitrate or powder residue which might be on the hands will be hardened
into the paraffin and will slip off with the paraffin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you say nitrates, I believe you used the word "residue"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Powder residue and nitrates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is nitrate a compound which is in gunpowder residue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is what they call the dermal nitrate test, I believe is
the correct name that they give it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does gunpowder generally have included in it some sort of nitrate
compound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If I were firing a pistol, would this pistol leave a nitrate on
my hands that would be detectable by the paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It should, unless it is awful tight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean by "awful tight"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. You could have an automatic which very easily could keep you
from having nitrate on your hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let's assume that we were taking a .38 caliber pistol. You
have seen the pistol which Lee Harvey Oswald had in his possession at the
time he was apprehended.</p>

<p>Let's assume I were firing that pistol. Would it leave some residue on
my hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It should.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Suppose I were to wash my hands between the time I fired it
and the time you took the paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would hurt the test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It would cut down the test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now if I were firing it, would it necessarily show on both hands?
Suppose I were right-handed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Depends on the location of your left hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, generally from your experience, is there any particular
location for a right-handed person to keep his hand when he is firing a pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Police officers are taught to keep their left hand near the pistol
handle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As an element of controlling it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. As an element of controlling, and also an element which, if you
should get wounded in your right shoulder, you would have the left hand to take
the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you keep it near then, I assume that you would get the nitrate
on the other hand, too, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Very likely that you would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Suppose I were unloading a pistol and taking the cartridge case
out and putting them in my left hand or handling the chamber where the
cartridge cases had been, would this leave nitrate deposits on my hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Suppose you were to examine my hands and you were to find
no nitrate deposits at all. Would you say that this conclusively shows that
I did not fire a pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, does it conclusively show I had not fired a pistol within
the last 6 or 8 or 10 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Well, a lot would depend what kind of pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, suppose it were a .38 caliber pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Then it would depend on whether you had cleaned your hands
or whether you had had gloves on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, suppose I were to tell you I didn't have gloves on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Had you washed your hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, would this make much of a difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Washing your hands would make a difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, suppose you were to examine me for firing a
rifle such as a bolt-action rifle rather than an automatic or semiautomatic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Would you expect to find nitrate residue on my hands that a paraffin test would
show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Chances are smaller on a rifle than it would be with a revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Because your chamber is enclosed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What difference does that make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The powder couldn't get out like a pistol where the cylinder is
open, and there is no casing around the cylinder of a revolver, and the chamber
of a rifle, it is enclosed with the metal all the way around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I operate the bolt on the rifle, does that make a difference
about letting the gas or residue escape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; all your explosives have already gone down the barrel.
It is not coming down the side when you operate the chamber. There is no
pressure there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What you are saying then is, that it is the pressure at the time
of firing in an open chamber that creates the major portion of this residue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you were to have a positive nitrate test on a person's hands,
and by positive, I mean it would show the presence of nitrate, would you say,
without knowing anything about the firearm that the person fired, that it was
more likely that he had fired a .38 caliber revolver, or a bolt-action rifle?</p>

<p>I mean a nonautomatic revolver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Let me get your question to see if I am correct. If there were
nitrates present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. In my own mind would I come to the conclusion that it would
probably come from a revolver? Rather than a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, nonautomatic revolver, as opposed to a rifle. Which would
be more likely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The revolver would be more likely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you said that you took the paraffin casts off the hands. Do
you generally take it of both hands when you take a paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; we do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you take a usual paraffin test, do you take it of any other
part of the body other than the hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In this case, did you take it of any other portion of the body
other than the hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What other portion of the body did you take it of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The right side of his cheek and face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The right side of Lee Harvey Oswald's cheek and face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who directed you to take it there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he particularly say why he wanted it taken there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I didn't ask the questions why he wanted it. I was ordered to
take it from him, and I took it because I had the order to take the test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there an order to take the left cheek also, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you say that you had been making paraffin tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Since 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Roughly, how many of those do you do in a month on an average?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would be hard to say. If I hit it lucky, I won't make too many.
If it hits on some other man's duty. It would be hard to say how many I have
made over a period of time. I can say that I have made many.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Over these years, do you think you have made as many as 100?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would be hard to say. I am not going to go into any actual
figures because it would be guesswork.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let me ask you this. Of the paraffin tests that you have
made, how many have you made of a cheek or cheeks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. One.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that with Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Other than that, you have never made a paraffin test of anyone's
cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular reason why you might not have in any other case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It has never been requested of me before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Based on your knowledge and information about the science of
paraffin tests, do you know whether or not it is a common practice or not a
common practice to make it of one cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It is not a common practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular reason it is not a common practice, that you
can think of or know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Firing a revolver, should he fire a revolver, I would say the
revolver most likely would be far enough away where powder residue wouldn't
reach his cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Firing a rifle, you get your chamber enclosed with steel metal
around it, and the chances of powder residue would be very remote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you fired a bolt-action rifle at all before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How close would the chamber be to the cheek as you would be
looking through the sight of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Be several inches to the rear of the chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this have any effect on the paraffin test at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It sure would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about telescopic sights? Would that push your face back
further or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Push it even further back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this have an effect on the paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The further you get from the chamber, the less possibility of
getting powder residue on it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you made the paraffin cast on the cheek, did you also
paint it on with this brush that you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To about a quarter of an inch thickness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Not quite that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you put the gauze on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you put some more paraffin on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do? Did you cool it with water, or let it naturally
harden by room temperature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Nature cools it from room temperature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you removed it from the cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you need a scissors when you removed it from the cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do with these paraffin tests after you made them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I placed them in a manila, large manila envelope separately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I walked out of Captain Fritz' office, and I had a couple of
patrolmen trying to weed their way through the news media so that I could have
walking room to get to the elevator to get back to the fourth floor, the ID bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The news media had the third floor pretty well jammed at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I would say it was pretty well jammed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time of the night was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Approximately 9 o'clock, I would say, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Lee Harvey Oswald say anything to you as you were removing
these casts, that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Very little, other than what I repeated to you before, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
knew what I was trying to do, and that I was wasting my time, that he didn't
know anything about what we were accusing him of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Lee Harvey Oswald leave Captain Fritz' office at that time
or did he stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I didn't go back, I couldn't tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He didn't come out with you, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were any remarks of any kind made to you by any of the people
in the hallway, nonpolice officers, as you left the office? Questions or remarks
or what have you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did they say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. They kept storming questions at me, "What have you got
in that sack, what have you got in that sack, you owe it to the news media to
give it to us, what have you got in that sack?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this just come from one person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. All of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how many of them were there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. They had the hallways blocked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you reply to them at all or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I didn't answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then went up to the fourth floor to the lab, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I initialed the cast, sealed them, and placed them in our locked
evidence room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did they go after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. They go to our city-county laboratory for analysis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is that city-county laboratory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. At Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know when they went there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The following morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you get the results from this analysis at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The results were obtained by our bureau. I didn't get the
results.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what these results were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I understand&mdash;I haven't seen them personally&mdash;but I understand
they are positive, the ones of his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By positive, you mean they showed the presence of nitrates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. They showed the presence of nitrates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the one on the cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The one of his cheek was negative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were any conclusions made because of either the positive results
from the test on his hands or the negative result on the test of the cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. In my own mind, I didn't expect any positive report from the
cheek to start with. But to cut down criticism and to satisfy the public and to
show the world that we tried to cover it very well, we did it for possibly any
future&mdash;I don't know how to word it&mdash;any complaints that might come later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By complaints, you mean people that <span class="locked">might&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Might question why you did or why you didn't do it on something
this big. We felt like the public should know that we done the best that
we knew how.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Even though you didn't expect to have results?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I didn't personally, and I am the one that made it.</p>

<p>From my experience with paraffin casts and from my experience in shooting
rifles, common sense will tell you that a man firing a rifle has got very little
chance of getting powder residue on his cheek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever made a paraffin cast of your cheek after you fired
a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever made a paraffin test of anyone else's cheek after that
person fired a rifle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I believe I am on record that that is the first paraffin test I
ever made of a cheek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever read periodicals discussing the paraffin test? Any
limitations of its use to determine whether or not a person fired a rifle by
making a cast of the cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; I haven't read anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Basically then, your reasons for reaching this conclusion are your
own personal reasons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What you earlier described as the chamber being an enclosed
chamber, is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which you said that the gases would not come out of under
pressure, and when the chamber would be open for the ejection of a shell from
a bolt-action rifle, at that time there would be no bad pressure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. All your pressure is gone forward through your barrel. There
is no pressure on the chamber when you operate it after the shot is fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In contrast with a nonautomatic revolver, when I pull the trigger,
is the back of the chamber open then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It is open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other information or opinion you can give us with
regard to the paraffin tests that might be relevant. Anything you can think
of, whether or not I have asked it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I believe you have covered just about everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I call myself a country lawyer, and I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I am a country boy. I was raised on the farm myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, maybe we both have something in common.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Still live there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant, did you make any other tests or obtain any other evidence
or information from Lee Harvey Oswald other than the paraffin that
you made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I obtained palm prints from Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you do this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Immediately before we made&mdash;no, immediately after, I am
sorry, immediately after we made the paraffin test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I would assume you did it afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That is right. It was after we made the tests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when you used the phrase a while ago&mdash;I mean that when
we were discussing shortly before we were taking this deposition just what you
did do insofar as your being involved in this <span class="locked">investigation&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In that discussion did I in any way tell you what to say, or
did you just tell me what you did in the nature of the proceedings here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I told you just what I did. I haven't been prompted by no one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, what did you do when you took the palm print?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We took them back upstairs to the ID bureau for comparison
purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At the time you carried back the paraffin casts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No. We came back and got the palm prints after I delivered
the paraffin tests upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Again, would this be normal procedure to take a palm print in
Captain Fritz' office as opposed to your own laboratory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; it would be something different. Usually we have them
coming up to our identification bureau for that purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular reason that you know of why Lee Harvey Oswald
wasn't brought up to your identification bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Because of the people in the hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. The news media in the hallways, and danger of removing Lee
Harvey Oswald through the mass of newspapermen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the newspapermen say anything to you as you went down
the hallway to Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Everytime that you went through there they asked you all
kinds of questions on what you had and what were you doing and how much
longer is it going to take, and what have you proved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you answer any of these questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got back in the office in Captain Fritz'
office? What did you find there? Who did you find in Captain Fritz' office
when you came back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Same two officers that I mentioned, besides Detective Dhority
and Detective Leavelle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was Lee Oswald present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Lee Oswald was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any conversation with Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None other than telling him that I had to have palm prints
of his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he have anything to say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Cooperative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether he made any objection to the
taking of any palm prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he request that he have an attorney present at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. He didn't request one. He would not sign the fingerprint card
when I asked him. We have a place on this card for the prisoner's signature,
and I asked him would he please sign that, and he said he wouldn't sign anything
until he talked to an attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ask for an attorney or say anything about an attorney
when you took the paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you say when he said he would not sign the fingerprint
card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. That was all right with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you just take the palm prints, or did you also take fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. We took both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your process of doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Rolling his hands, an ink roller over his palm, and then we have
a metal cylinder bar about an inch in diameter that we place the card on and
then roll his hands to make it print on the fingerprint card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever taken palm prints before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Based on your knowledge and information, what is the fact as to
whether or not palm prints are distinct means of identification of a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Just as good as fingerprints The only thing that I could add to
that would be, there is no way of classifying palm prints, where with fingerprints,
we have the system where we classify them and can go look them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can offer with reference to the investigation
of the assassination or the shooting of Officer Tippit other than the
paraffin test and the palm and fingerprint tests that you took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None that I can think of right now, other than printing pictures
of both killings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything else that Lee Oswald said other than
the fact he would not sign his name to the card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. He had very little to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you can think of, whether I have asked it or
not, that in anyway might be relevant to this investigation here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Not that I can think of at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now were you on duty on Sunday morning, November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any general comment among the police officers, what I
call the line officers, about the presence of the press in the police headquarters
building during this period of time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; we discussed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Without mentioning any names which might embarrass any individual,
and without necessarily quoting yourself, what was the general nature
or tenor of that discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Disgusted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any objections that were voiced about this, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not the presence of the press in
any way affected the handling of this matter by the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It would be just like you carrying on your work in your office
when you had it full of newspapermen or anybody else, as far as that is
concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there people other than newspapermen generally in the
police headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. It is hard to tell just who was who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you were not there at the time of the shooting of Lee Harvey
Oswald by Jack Ruby, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. No; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the television showing of the film that ran during the&mdash;during
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have had some experience, you said earlier, as a photographer,
I believe, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not the presence of light such as
you say you saw in the movie film that you saw&mdash;what is the fact as to whether
or not the presence of these lights would affect the ability of officers protecting
Lee Harvey Oswald to discern movements of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Blinding them. The flash from the many cameras that were
present in the basement of the city hall, the lights set up by your TV cameramen,
all of this would work against the officers in safeguarding any prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you can think of with reference to the
security matters of Lee Harvey Oswald that might be relevant here other than
your statements about the press and the problems of light?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Other than the movement of him with the throngs of press men,
which the security I thought was very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. None that I can think of at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you care to add in this deposition that
might in any way be helpful or relevant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I think this pretty well covers it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we want to thank you very much for your cooperation in
coming down here, sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I am glad to come. Hate to come under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We hate to be here under these circumstances. It is not a pleasant
job for any of us, but it is a job that has to be done. All right, sir.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that you have a right to, if you like, to read your deposition and
sign it, or else you can waive reading and have the court reporter send it to us
in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. I believe I will come back and let her show it to me, and I will
sign it then.</p>

<h2 id="t286">TESTIMONY OF J.&nbsp;B. HICKS</h2>

<p>The testimony of J.&nbsp;B. Hicks was taken at 3:10 p.m., on April 7, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel
of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Please stand up and hold up your right hand.</p>

<p>(Witness complying.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give here today
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please, and your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. J.&nbsp;B. Hicks, 4318 Matilda, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I am with the police department, city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are with the special section of the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. The identification bureau; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been with the identification bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Let's see, about, a little over 7 years now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me about yourself&mdash;where you were born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I was born in Irving, Tex., which is a suburb out here of Dallas,
September 29, 1918.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I finished high school, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Then&mdash;you mean where I went to work and from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I worked a short while for Sanger Bros., I believe 3 or 4 months
or so, then I was employed by Higgenbotham-Bailey Logan Co. which is a
wholesale company here in Dallas; from there I went to work with the police
department where I have been for a little over 22 years now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work do you do with the crime lab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I do the usual, oh, photography work, fingerprint comparisons,
darkroom work and anything that might come under the crime lab; the crime
scene, search duties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You work under Lieutenant Day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I work under Lieutenant Day; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; I was off duty that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you were called back to duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time of day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I had&mdash;my wife, I believe it was called me from her work. She
had heard of the happening and knowing that I was off, of course, she figured I
would be called, so when she called me, I called in to Lieutenant Knight, who
is also in the identification bureau, and told him that I was getting ready and
if they needed me to report, to call me and tell me where to go to, and so he did.
Oh, I don't know exactly how long it had taken place and the exact time that
he did call me. The time right there, I can't recall. I know I did get to work
somewhere around 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go to work, at the crime lab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; they told me to report directly to Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went down there what did you find?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Lieutenant Day&mdash;well, first I saw Chief Lumpkin, who told me
Lieutenant Day was there in the building and to report to him on the sixth
floor, I believe it was and he and Detective Studebaker, I believe it was were
the two that were still on that particular floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Day and Studebaker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you do some work with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Yes; there was&mdash;well, no. Lieutenant Day was dusting several
items around there for fingerprints at the time and Mr. Studebaker had taken
some pictures and was still taking a few others. I assisted him in moving the
equipment back and forth and I don't know, I don't believe I actually took any of
the pictures upstairs; however, I was there when some of them were taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There were three exploded cartridge hulls on the floor, weren't
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Yes; I am not sure; I believe they had already been picked up
and removed when I arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who picked them up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; I don't know off hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you later see them in your laboratory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I believe I saw one of the particular ones there that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; I did not. I think Lieutenant Day had all of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you do ballistics work in your laboratory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; we have no facilities for firing or testfiring any of the
guns there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you do any identification work on either the assassination of
President Kennedy or the investigation of Tippit's murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Do you mean as far as fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; and things of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Let me see now, I took a set of Oswald's prints from him that
night some time. I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 9 o'clock or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. It was some time in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you took the prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I was in Captain Fritz' office. In other words, I made those on
an inkless pad. That's a pad we use for fingerprinting people without the black
ink that they make for the records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I was one of the two who made the paraffin cast on Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Sergeant Barnes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you ever done that before, the paraffin cast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald protest any or did he permit you to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; he was willing and had no comment on it as far as the
making of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you test the paraffin cast; did you make any test on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; that's done by the lab at Parkland Hospital which Lieutenant
Alexander, I believe is in charge there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did not do it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What has been your experience with paraffin casts? How accurate
are they in determining whether or not a person has fired a firearm previously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. My own personal opinion is that it is not an exact conclusive evidence
that, if you are familiar with that test, anything containing nitrate might
show up on a test of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it usual to find any trace of nitrate on the face if a rifle has
been fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. That is the first time that I had the opportunity to make a paraffin
test on a person's face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never made one before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Never before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The other tests were always on the hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there some reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I had never had the occasion arise that I know of where anyone
had that suggested, that a paraffin test be made of a cheek. On other occasions
they were only interested in the hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you do anything else with respect to the investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I don't recall anything outstanding that I did in the investigation
further there. Now, I know we were all pretty well busy there until about 2 or
2:30 in the morning but most of it was, I would imagine regular officework and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
just back and forth if someone had asked did we get a picture of this and
picture of that; well, I can't recall any other particular item that I might have
done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you present when Oswald was arraigned in the identification
bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; I left just a few minutes before that, I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you leave; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I left it was shortly after 2. I don't know the exact time, maybe
2:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think he was arraigned after you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I am rather certain that he was because I believe I would have
known about it had he been arraigned before I left because there is only one
door in our office to go out and had any other group been there, I would have
noticed it, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to Oswald any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I only asked him his name when I made his fingerprints and I
did not question him or go to any details on talking to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were not present at any showups of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make any fingerprint study in this case or palmprint
study?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir&mdash;any comparisons to the prints that we had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did not compare the prints you took of Oswald with any
specimen that might have been taken from the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see a paper sack in the items that were taken from
the Texas School Book Depository building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Paper bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Paper bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; I did not. It seems like there was some chicken bones or
maybe a lunch; no, I believe that someone had gathered it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, this was another type of bag made out of brown paper;
did you ever see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. No, sir; I don't believe I did. I don't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I believe that's all, Mr. Hicks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be written up and submitted to you for signature if you
want, or you can waive signature; which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Well, when would I have to come back to sign this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Probably next week sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. Well, that will be all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Suit yourself, either way. If you want to waive signature it's
all right with us or if you want to come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>. I will come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, she will notify you. Thanks very much.</p>

<h2 id="t289">TESTIMONY OF HARRY D. HOLMES</h2>

<p>The testimony of Harry D. Holmes was taken at 4 p.m., on April 2, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir, would you rise and raise your right hand and be sworn.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you please state your name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Harry D. Holmes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Holmes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. 1711 McManus, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Postal inspector.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For the U.S. Post Office Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I am 57.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your educational background? Did you go to high school
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I graduated from high school in Kansas City, and went 2 years
to William Jewell College at Liberty, Mo., and went almost through my third
year in Kansas City. Went to dental college in Kansas City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Well, all that time I was working in the post office as a clerk,
and about that time the war broke out and I went into the Postal Inspection
Service in April 1942, and have been a postal inspector ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you been in Dallas ever since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; I came here July 1, 1948. I have been here ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you on November 22, 1963, around noon or so. That
is the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I was in my office on the fifth floor of the terminal annex
building, located at the corner of Houston and Commerce Streets, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Houston and Commerce Streets in Dallas. Now, where is Commerce
with relation to Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Commerce, Main, Elm&mdash;two blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So Commerce would be two blocks south of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what corner is your building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It is on the northeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The northeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; well, now, wait a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I mean the building itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. This is the reflecting pool, and here is the underpass, comes
down like this, and this is Elm, and this is Main, and this is Commerce, and my
building is right here. Right here is the School Book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is north?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; that is "cattywampus." This would be the southwest
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You have now corrected your testimony by drawing
a diagram. What corner is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Southwest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what side of the building is your office where you were sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. On the north side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From your office looking north, what building would you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. The Texas School Book Depository Building. And I am on the
fifth floor of my building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you on the fifth floor about the time the motorcade was
coming down Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the motorcade turn from Main onto Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What direction did it turn on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It turned north on Houston to Elm, and then turned left on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To go down to the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how fast was the motorcade going when you saw it, if you
have any estimate on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I would say 15 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you describe what you saw and heard then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. As it came out of Main Street, the President was sitting on
the right in the back seat. His wife was on the left. Governor Connally,
whom I also recognized, was sitting on the right of the middle seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you looking with the aid of any optical instrument?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I had a pair of 7½ x 50 binoculars. They were acknowledging
the applause of the crowd and kind of waving, but not standing up. This is a
short block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From Main to Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. To Elm is really not more than a good full block, but the motorcade
turned north on Houston and went to Elm and turned left on Elm where
it started on a downgrade to what we refer to as a triple underpass. As it
turned in front of the School Book Depository, I heard what to me sounded like
firecrackers, and it was my recollection that there were three of them.</p>

<p>I had my binoculars on this car, on the Presidential car all the time. I
realized something was wrong, but I thought they were dodging somebody
throwing things at the car like firecrackers or something, but I did see dust fly
up like a firecracker had burst up in the air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you see the dust?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Off of President Kennedy and I couldn't tell you which one of
the cracks of the firecracker resulted in this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any recollection of the amount of time that elapsed
between each of the three sounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I have tried to set a time, but it just escapes me. Honestly, I
couldn't say. They were rather rapid. Say 20 seconds or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean 20 seconds elapsed between all three, or less than 20
seconds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Possibly 20 seconds, or half a minute and then crack and kind
of a lapse and then another crack. I wouldn't want to swear to that. I have
tried to recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there more time between the first and the second one, or
between the second and third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I couldn't tell you that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Mr. Kennedy leaned over against his wife, Mrs. Kennedy, as this
thing, firecracker, looked like, come out. The car almost came to a stop, and
Mrs. Kennedy pulled loose of him and crawled out over the turtleback of this
Presidential car and was almost off of the back of the turtleback when a man
from a car next to it came running up and I never&mdash;I got the impression in one
way that she was trying to help him on the bumper.</p>

<p>I got the impression in another way that he was trying to push her back in
the seat for fear she would fall and hurt herself. It was so quick that that
was my impression, and in fact we discussed it. There was several of us looking
out of the window, why she was going out over this car, and we were arguing
that she was trying to help the Secret Service man or the Secret Service man was
trying to get her back in the car, and this was our impression.</p>

<p>Policemen jumped off of the motorcycles that were along the route and with
drawn pistols started rushing into the crowd. I saw many people down on the
ground, and I have one particular couple in mind that I had watched on a bench,
sitting on a park bench that the man had this woman down. I remember my
impression at the time that he was trying to take a gun away from her, or something,
and by that time I decided maybe there was a gun involved in it instead
of firecrackers.</p>

<p>He had her down on the ground. But then it later developed that he was
trying to protect her from the shots. But then I didn't know that at the time.
And I did watch her as they got up. Then different people hid around behind
pillars in this arbor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Then just people went from every direction hunting around the
railroad yard and among the cars parked in the area. I saw a policeman
rushing into the School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this a motorcycle policemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I did definitely see motorcycle policemen, one of&mdash;one or two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
three&mdash;with their white helmets, and these motorcycle uniforms rushed up in
the crowd with drawn pistols. And I thought maybe they might have been
shooting to frighten the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did the noise sound like it came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It reverberated among the buildings and I couldn't tell you. It
sounded like from the crowd over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else happen that afternoon that you think is important
insofar as the investigation of the assassination is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I watched for hours from that vantage point up there with my
binoculars, hoping I would see someone running across the railroad tracks, or
maybe that I could get word to the police as to where they were, because it was
like a birdseye view of the panorama of the whole area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone run across the railroad track?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No. I saw nothing suspicious and I am a trained suspicioner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to see what the court reporter has down in her notes.</p>

<p>Now, what was the next contact you had with anything connected with the
assassination or the investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I never quit. I didn't get to bed for 2 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Tell us what you did that you feel might be important that we
should record here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Of course I was in contact with the chief inspector in Washington,
who was listening to the radio reports, and I remember once he called and
he said, "Well, now, could the shots have come from the terminal annex building.
Has your office been shaken out, the annex." Of course we gave that attention
but there was nothing of any nature there of any importance. I was doing all
I could to help other agencies.</p>

<p>One of the box clerks downstairs came up after an hour or so when the radio
reports came in about the apprehension of Lee Oswald following the shooting of
Officer Tippit, and said, "I think you ought to know, Mr. Holmes, that we rented
a box downstairs to a Lee Oswald recently, and it is box number so-and-so".</p>

<p>That was my first tip that he had a box downstairs in the terminal annex.
That box is No. 6225.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am handing you what has been marked as Holmes Deposition
Exhibit No. 1. I will ask you to state what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is a photo copy of the original box rental application completed
by Lee H. Oswald covering box No. 6225, which he completed on November
the 1st, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where it says, date of application, that you gave, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice over here in&mdash;a notation on the side 11-22-63, with some
initials on it. Do you know what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Those are my initials and they indicate that I took the original
box application from the post office records on that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I turned it over to an FBI agent at a later date. I don't know
when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did any particular employee ever remember actually dealing
with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He could not recall what the man looked like. He couldn't
identify him from what he later saw his pictures in the paper. He could not
identify him as actually being the man that rented the box, because I have
talked to him about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, on Deposition Exhibit 1, for the name of the firm or the
corporation, it says, "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" and "American Civil Liberties
Union," is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And kind of business, it says, "nonprofit," is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then business address, there is a dash running through there,
and home address is "3610 North Beckley," is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's correct. That is the address he gave as the residential
address when he rented the box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then there is a signature "Lee H. Oswald," with the date of
November 1, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. This clerk told me that the man definitely filled this thing out
himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does the clerk remember seeing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There is a stamp, which I assume is your post office stamp, that
says on there, "Date box opened, November 1, 1963," and the box number
is written in as "6225".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There&mdash;is there less charge for a nonprofit organization box than
there is for anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No. That box went closed for lack of payment of rent on
December 31.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you found out that this was his box, did you keep any
surveillance on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. We kept a 24-hour, round-the-clock surveillance from about
well into Sunday, I think, 3 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the Sunday that Lee Harvey Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many box keys were given out, according to your records, for
the box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. One.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that one ever turned back to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Didn't the police have it? I saw it&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw it at the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I asked them about it, and he asked could this be it? I had
taken the duplicate key with me to see if I could match it. They have numbers
on them and I did. The detective pulled it out and said, "Is this it," in the
presence of Captain Fritz, and I matched the numbers, and it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were the numbers the same for the box number as the key
number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; it was a key number. Fritz kept it with the evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about this box or the application, Deposition Exhibit
1 here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Only that an occasional Russian newspaper was received in
that box after we began to watch it from then on until it was closed. No first-class
mail. What is "The Daily Worker," sir? It's been the "Daily Worker,"
now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There was some newspaper that came? Well&mdash;some American
newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It is what used to be "The Daily Worker," came, and a couple
of Russian newspapers came there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. From Minsk. That was her hometown, Marina's hometown
in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else in connection with this box and this
application that you care to talk about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what was the next thing that you had contact with pertaining
to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Saturday <span class="locked">morning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This would be November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Twenty-third. I came into the lobby of the terminal annex,
and the postal inspector that was on duty mentioned that the FBI agent had
called to inquire as to how they could obtain an original post office money order.</p>

<p>He said he had told them that they would have to get it in Washington, but
would have to know the number of the post office money order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
So he was worrying then as to how he could get that number.</p>

<p>So I knew about the post office money order. They said that Oswald&mdash;they
said that also this FBI agent had passed on the information that, I don't
know whether he told him or I called the FBI after&mdash;I went on up to my
office, but somewhere I got the information that the FBI had knowledge that a
gun of this particular Italian make and caliber had been purchased from
Klein's Sporting Goods in Chicago, that it had been purchased, and the FBI
furnished me the information that a money order of some description in the
amount of $21.95 had been used as reimbursement for the gun that had been
purchased from Klein's in Chicago, and that the purchase date was March 20,
1963. I immediately had some men begin to search the Dallas money order
records with the thought that they might have used a U.S. postal money order
to buy this gun.</p>

<p>I didn't have any luck, so along about 11 o'clock in the morning, Saturday,
I had my boys call the postal inspector. Oh, wait a minute, let's back up.</p>

<p>I had my secretary go out and purchase about half a dozen books on outdoor-type
magazines such as Field and Stream, with the thought that I might locate
this gun to identify it, and I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have what magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Field and Stream of November 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You found a Field and Stream magazine of just November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It was the current magazine on the rack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got it to look for a gun and identified it in this magazine?
Is this the page? I will call it Holmes Deposition Exhibit 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Here, page 98.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, it is on the back of a page numbered 98, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Or the front side. I am marking on the top of it, "Holmes Deposition
Exhibit 2."</p>

<p>Was that the page you tore out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice there is a magazine or there is a number of guns identified
on that page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I see one circled in red, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who circled that in red?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then I see that it is a picture with a gun with a scope on it
and it says, "6.5 Italian carbine," in big black letters. And underneath it
says, "Late military issue. Only 40 inches overall. Weighs 7 lbs. Shows only
slight use, test-fired and head spaced, ready for shooting. Turned-down bolt
6-shot, clip fed, rear sight." And it is marked "$12.78."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. With scope, it is $19.95.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There is a number. That $12.78 says "C20-1196." And underneath
that it says, "C20-750, carbine with brand new 4x¾" diameter (illustrated)
$19.95." Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then on the lower right-hand corner of the page there is a kind
of place for clipping out of coupons. It is marked "Klein's Sporting Goods at
227 West Washington Street, Chicago 6, Illinois," then there is a place for a
box to be checked. It says, "cash customers, send check or money order in
full. Unless otherwise specified, send $1.00 postage and handling on any size
order ... $1.50 on shotgun and rifles."</p>

<p>Then there is a place at the bottom of the page. It is a place for putting
the name and address and the city and State, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I notice on a piece of scrap paper you have taken the $19.95
which would be the exact amount for the rifle with the scope, and then added
the $1.50 for the charge that the coupon says for postage and handling and
you come up with a total of $21.45.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
I thought you said the FBI said $21.95?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He had, and that was the amount of money order I had been
looking for. So I had my postal inspector in charge call our Chicago office and
suggested that he get an inspector out to Klein's Sporting Goods and recheck
it for accuracy, that if our looking at the right gun in the magazine, they were
looking for the wrong money order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. So in about an hour Postal Inspector McGee of Chicago called
back then and said that the correct amount was $21.95&mdash;$21.45&mdash;excuse me, and
that the shipping&mdash;they had received this money order on March the 13th,
whereas I had been looking for March 20.</p>

<p>So then I passed the information to the men who were looking for this money
order stub to show which would designate, which would show the number of the
money order, and that is the only way you could find one.</p>

<p>I relayed this information to them and told them to start on the 13th because
he could have bought it that morning and that he could have gotten it
by airmail that afternoon, so they began to search and within 10 minutes
they called back and said they had a money order in that amount issued on,
I don't know that I show, but it was that money order in an amount issued at
the main post office, which is the same place as this post office box was at
that time, box 2915 and the money order had been issued early on the morning
of March the 12th, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. They are issued in blank. He has to fill it in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does it say the name of the person who is <span class="locked">purchased&mdash;purchasing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; you don't <span class="locked">get&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He had to fill it in himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mentioned another post office box, and a new number there.
When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Just now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, No. 2915?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is the box he had rented at the main post office before
he went to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say the main post office, what city and State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you learn about this, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't know that I can tell. Some clerk was passing information
to me and also it could have been that McGee, this inspector said it was sent to
box 2915, in Dallas. I couldn't tell you when I first realized he had this box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you what has been marked "Holmes Deposition Exhibit 3,"
and ask you to state what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is a photostatic copy of the original box rental application
covering the rental of box 2915, at the main post office in Dallas, Tex., which
shows that it was completed on October the 9th, 1962. The applicants name
was Lee H. Oswald, home address, 3519 Fairmore Avenue, Dallas, Tex. Signed
Lee H. Oswald. It shows that the box was closed on May 14, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, it is stamped date box opened, October 9, 1962. And that is
the same date that it appears to be written in handwriting at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, you found this postal money order and then what
did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Off the record, let me ask you something. I questioned him about
this box and all the angles with it during this interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to get to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I didn't know whether you wanted to put it in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to get to that. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I gave that information to my boss by telephone. He called
Washington immediately. Of course this information included the money order
number. This number was transmitted by phone to the chief inspector in Washington,
who immediately got the money order center at Washington to begin a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
search, which they use IBM equipment to kick out this money order, and about
7 o'clock Saturday night they did kick out the original money order and sent
it over by, so they said, by special conveyance to the Secret Service, chief of
Secret Service at Washington now, and it turned out, so they said, to be the
correct money order. I asked them by phone as to what it said on it, and it
said it had been issued to A.&nbsp;J. Hidell, which to me then was the tip that I had
the correct money order. Up to then I didn't know whether I had the correct
money order or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you know about the use of the name A.&nbsp;J. Hidell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. When the box was opened in the name of Lee H. Oswald. Because
for two reasons. I&mdash;one is, when he rented the post office box in New
Orleans, he used the name of A.&nbsp;J. Hidell as one of the persons entitled to receive
mail in that box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At that time did you know about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. In his billfold the police had found a draft registration card in
the name of A.&nbsp;J. Hidell on his person at the time of his arrest, and I had
seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else now about this money order? Do you have a record
of the number of the money order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what was the next thing you did in connection with the
investigation of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Well, throughout the entire period I was feeding change of addresses
as bits of information to the FBI and the Secret Service, and sort of
a coordinating deal on it, but then about Sunday morning about <span class="locked">9:20&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon me a second. (Discussion off the record.) Anything else
now, Mr Holmes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I might cover the record of his rental of the post office box in
New Orleans. Do you want me to go into that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. The box rental records at New Orleans show that on June the
3d, 1963, post office box 30061 was rented to L.&nbsp;H. Oswald. Let me see there.
Some of my information comes at times I see 30061 and at times I see 30016.
I had it two places. One is a written memorandum on that new setup, and
the other is what I took over the phone, and both of them show 61.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I think I got a copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is all right, you can go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. This is at the Lafayette Square Station in New Orleans. At
that time he showed his home address as 657 French Street, New Orleans. On
this box rental application card, he showed as being entitled to also receive mail
in the box, Marina Oswald, and A.&nbsp;J. Hidell. This box was closed on September
26, 1963, with instructions to forward mail addressed to 2515 West Fifth
Street, Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>At the time this information was checked out in New Orleans by Postal Inspector
Joe Zarza, two copies of the newspaper called "The Militant," were
found in the box, which had not yet been forwarded. But there was a slipup.
I hate to admit that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I presume my next part in connection with this was when I
joined the interrogation period of Oswald on Sunday morning of November 24
at about 9:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now. Let me ask you this. Just what was the occasion
of your joining this interrogation? How did you happen to be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I had been in and out of Captain Fritz' office on numerous occasions
during this 2½-day period.</p>

<p>On this morning I had no appointment. I actually started to church with my
wife. I got to church and I said, "You get out, I am going down and see if I
can do something for Captain Fritz. I imagine he is as sleepy as I am."</p>

<p>So I drove directly on down to the police station and walked in, and as I did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Captain Fritz motioned to me and said, "We are getting ready to have a last
interrogation with Oswald before we transfer him to the county jail. Would
you like to join us?"</p>

<p>I said "I would."</p>

<p>We went into his private room and closed the door, and those present were
Captain Will Fritz, of the Dallas Police Department, Forrest V. Sorrels, local
agent in charge of Secret Service, and Thomas J. Kelley, inspector, Secret
Service, from Washington, and also about three detectives who were not
identified to me, but simply were guarding Oswald who was handcuffed and
seated at Will Fritz' desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now. Will you state if you remember&mdash;do you have
a written memorandum there of that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if you would just let me ask you: When did you make
your written memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. On December 17, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if, using your memorandum to refresh your recollection,
you would just say what was said by any of the people there and just cover
the whole thing? I will take it up section by section. Just start out. This
started around 9:30, is that it, on Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir. Now, this is my impression, not what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice the first paragraph, you have an impression on that? I
wonder perhaps what we might do is, I am going to see if I have a copy of this,
and if I can, to attach just as a&mdash;is this an extra copy that you have here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; I guess you can. Let me tear that top off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to mark this as "Holmes Deposition Exhibit No. 4."
This is a memorandum of your interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That I dictated on December 17, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is about 4 weeks after the interview took place; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any notes from which you dictated this interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I had a few notes. I had no reason for such a statement
except that about that time the FBI asked me&mdash;they learned that I had been
in on this interrogation, and asked me if I would object to giving them a
statement as to what went on in that room, and this is my statement. Part of
it was from notes and part of it was from memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I notice&mdash;well, you might just, without even looking at the
memorandum, first just give us your general impression of what went on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. There was no formality to the interrogation. One man would
question Oswald. Another would interrupt with a different trend of thought, or
something in connection, and it was sort of an informal questioning or
interrogation.</p>

<p>Oswald was quite composed. He answered readily those questions that he
wanted to answer. He could cut off just like with a knife anything that he
didn't want to answer.</p>

<p>And those particular things that he didn't want to answer were anything
that pertained with the assassination of the President or the shooting of Officer
Tippit. He flatly denied any knowledge of either.</p>

<p>He was not particularly obnoxious. He seemed to be intelligent. He
seemed to be clearminded. He seemed to have a good memory, because in questioning
him about the boxes, which I had original applications in front of me,
he was pretty accurate. He knew box numbers and he answered these questions
readily and answered them truthfully, as verified by the box rental applications
that I had in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was Oswald wearing at the time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He was bareheaded. He had a sport shirt on and slacks, pair
of trousers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color trousers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Sort of a medium. On the light side I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't recall. It was not a loud shirt. It was not outstanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
I don't know what color actually he had on. I do know, I can tell you when
he put on the black sweater and all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He put on a black sweater?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Toward the end&mdash;that is the last thing on my memorandum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, do you remember Captain Fritz showing a map, showing
Oswald a map of the city of Dallas which had been recovered from his room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He didn't show the map. He only mentioned the map and asked
him about a certain map that had markings on it, and Oswald said, "Well, I
presume you have reference to a map that I had in my room that had some
X's on it."</p>

<p>And, he said, "Well, tell us about that one. Why were the X's on there?
What did that designate?"</p>

<p>And he said that, "I have no automobile. I have no means of conveyance.
I have to walk from where I am going most of the time. And I had my applications
in with Texas Employment Commission. They furnished me names
and addresses of places that had openings like I might could fill, and neighborhood
people had furnished me information on jobs I might could get. I was
seeking a job, and I would put these markings on this map so that I could plan
my itinerary around with less walking, and each one of those represented a
place where I went and interviewed for a job."</p>

<p>And he said, "You can check each one of them out if you want to."</p>

<p>Then Captain Fritz mentioned the X at the intersection of Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Well, he said, "That is the location of the Texas School Depository and I did
go there and interview for a job. In fact, I got a job there." He said, "That is
all the map amounts to."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else about that aspect of the interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember Inspector Kelley asking Oswald about his
religious views?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes. Someone, and I don't recall who, asked the first question
on that, but you got that Lenin business in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am deliberately asking you these questions before we get to your
memorandum, and I am just trying to get your memory first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. All right. Someone asked him about what his beliefs were, and
he said, "Well," about him being a Communist something. Someone referred
to his communism, and he said, "I am not a Communist. I am a Marxist."
And they said, what is the difference between Communist and Marxist, and he
said, "Well, a Communist is a Lenin Marxist, and I am a true Karl Marxist."</p>

<p>So, this Secret Service inspector asked, "What religion are you?" In other
words, I mean, "What faith are you, as far as religion?" And he said, "I have
no faith." And then he said, "I suppose you mean the Bible."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is right."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I have read the Bible. It is fair reading, but not very
interesting. But, as a matter of fact, I am a student of philosophy and I don't
consider the Bible as even a reasonable or intelligent philosophy. I don't think
much of it," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone there ask him if Cuba would be better off since the
President was assassinated? Do you remember anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't recall a question on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anyone asking him a question about the rifle,
or there was a picture of Oswald holding a rifle. Do you remember anything
about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes. They said, "We have a picture of you holding"&mdash;actually
it came up before then in an interrogation of him about this rifle that came to
this post office box.</p>

<p>They asked him, "Do you own a rifle?" He said, "No."</p>

<p>Well, "Have you shot a rifle since you have been out of the Marines?"</p>

<p>He said, "No." Then he backed up and said, "Well, possibly a small bore,
maybe a .22, but not anything larger since I have left the Marine Corps."</p>

<p>"Do you own a rifle?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely not. How would I afford a rifle. I make $1.25 an hour. I can't
hardly feed myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Then he said, "What about this picture of you holding this rifle?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what you are talking about."</p>

<p>He just cut it off. As I recall, he refused to even acknowledge there was such
a picture. They had none of these exhibits in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't have the picture at the time in the room when you
were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone say anything about his living on a so-called Neely
Street, that you remember? Or Captain Fritz, did he say that he told Oswald
that friends had visited him there and that friends had seen Oswald there?
Do you remember at this time anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't remember his answer to it, whether he did answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was anything&mdash;pardon me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I remember Fritz, I think, describe the fellow, and he just
ignored it. He was vague about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember any statements that Oswald made about any
fight in New Orleans about Marxism or fair play for Cuba or anything? Does
that ring a bell with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I knew all about it, and I knew the police records and all, but
I don't know that it was brought up in that room at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was anything in that room&mdash;was he asked about knowing Alek
Hidell? Or anything about Alek Hidell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I brought it up first as to did he ever have a package sent to
him from anywhere. I said, "Did you receive mail through this box 2915 under
the name of any other name than Lee Oswald," and he said, "Absolutely not."</p>

<p>"What about a package to an A.&nbsp;J. Hidell?"</p>

<p>He said, "No."</p>

<p>"Well, did you order a gun in that name to come there?"</p>

<p>"No, absolutely not."</p>

<p>"Had one come under that name, could this fellow have gotten it?"</p>

<p>He said, "Nobody got mail out of that box but me; no, sir." "Maybe my
wife, but I couldn't say for sure whether my wife ever got mail, but it is possible
she could have."</p>

<p>"Well, who is A.&nbsp;J. Hidell?" I asked him.</p>

<p>And he said, "I don't know any such person."</p>

<p>I showed him the box rental application for the post office box in New
Orleans and I read from it. I said, "Here this shows as being able to receive,
being entitled to receive mail is Marina Oswald." And he said, "Well, that is
my wife, so what?"</p>

<p>And I said also it says "A.&nbsp;J. Hidell."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know anything about that."</p>

<p>That is all he would say about it.</p>

<p>Then Captain Fritz interrupted and said, "Well, what about this card we
got out of your billfold? This draft registration card, he called it, where it
showed A.&nbsp;J. Hidell."</p>

<p>"Well, that is the only time that I recall he kind of flared up and he said,
"Now, I have told you all I am going to tell you about that card in my billfold."
He said, "You have the card yourself, and you know as much about it as I do."
And he showed a little anger. Really the only time that he flared up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there ever any mention at the time you were there of the
fact that he had a right to have a lawyer present? Do you remember anything
about that at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever ask to have a lawyer present? Do you remember
anything about that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Oh, yes; they talked about a lawyer, and he said he <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was the conversation? Who said what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't know who started the conversation, but it had gotten
into "Do you have an attorney?" He said, "No."</p>

<p>"Well, do you want an attorney?"</p>

<p>And he said, "No." Then he said, "Well, I tried to get a fellow from New
York." But he said he wasn't able to get hold of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
And I think he is a Civil Liberties Union lawyer. He mentioned something
about he looks after their interests in New York. I don't remember the name,
but they discussed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be something like Abt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; short name. That could well be it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else? Did he ever ask for any other lawyer or for
any lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember that while this was going on if the chief of
police came to the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes. Along toward the end of the interrogation several people
kept milling around outside of Captain Fritz' office and I noticed the chief of
police out there, and they would rap on the door, and once in a while crack
the door and look in, and gave all the appearance of being impatient.</p>

<p>But Captain Fritz is a quiet and deliberate sort of individual and said, "Don't
worry about the men. If you got any more questions, ask him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who would be the people knocking and tapping on the window
and would be impatient?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It was Chief Curry, and I didn't recognize the others, but there
were people who later took him on downstairs, so they were waiting. They
wanted to make this transfer, is what it was. In fact, the captain mentioned,
he said, "We are going to have a little while to talk. I don't know how long,
because they want to effect this transfer."</p>

<p>And everybody assumed that that was why they were getting impatient
outside about, they wanted to go ahead and complete the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there glass walls on Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; with venetian blinds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were the venetian blinds closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. They were closed, but you could see around the edges and
through and every once in a while someone would lift a blind, and once in a
while they would crack the door and look in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were the venetian blinds inside or outside, or do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't know, to tell you the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how big was the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Just about as wide as this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You want to pace it off here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I would say 10 by 15, personally, feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. One door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there any other people outside there that morning other
than the police officers, that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I recognized a couple of FBI agents. I couldn't call their
names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any press people that you recognized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Of course, when we speak of outside Fritz' office, it is still
an inclosure where you go out another door to go into the hall where the
public mills around. He had a suite of rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had one of the rooms in that suite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes. In fact, he is in charge of all the rooms, but he has one
private office of his own, and that is where we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You do remember Chief Curry coming in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember any conversation that transpired between Chief
Curry and Captain Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. As Chief Curry came in, someone handed some clothes on a
hanger. It was maybe a sports shirt and a couple of pair of slacks, and I
recall there were two sweaters and he said, "I will just take one of those
sweaters." They gave him one sweater that he did not like. No, he said,
"Give me the black one."</p>

<p>So he takes it, a little slip-over sweater. So, while he was putting that on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Chief Curry came around the other side of the desk and took Will Fritz over
in the corner and they bowed their heads and discussed in an undertone. Apparently,
I got the impression they weren't trying to hide anything from us,
but they didn't want Oswald to overhear what they were saying. They were
mumbling in an undertone and I didn't distinguish one thing that was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Oswald ask to have a sweater or some clothes brought in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes. Well, I don't know that he asked. I will take that back.
I don't know that he asked. All I know, they handed it in and said, "Do you
want any of those clothes, or do you want to change your clothes?"</p>

<p>And he said, "I will take one of the sweaters." They gave him the wrong
sweater and he didn't like that and he asked for the other. And they uncuffed
him and he slipped his arm in and they handcuffed him back up, and that is
the only change. It was a black slipover kind of <b>V</b>-neck sweater.</p>

<p>Then they walked him out of the office and I stayed in the office with the
two Secret Service men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you didn't accompany Oswald when they left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you first learn that Oswald had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I told Sorrels, I said, "I have my car down the street. Let's
go down to my office, because it is directly across the reflecting pool from
this School Depository Building and from the sheriff's office and entrance
where they will take him in. Let's go down to my office and we can look at it
from my window and have a better eye view in case anything happens." And
he said, "Well, I have my car down there too, and I will need to have it to get
back to my office, so I will just take my own car."</p>

<p>So, I immediately went downstairs and got in my car and proceeded to my
office, which probably took me ten minutes.</p>

<p>When I got to the sidewalk of the terminal annex I parked my car and
walked right in the door. One of the inspectors who was watching this box,
they still had the surveillance on the box&mdash;said, "Well, they got Oswald now."</p>

<p>I said, "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Well, they have shot Oswald."</p>

<p>They had a radio sitting there going. I said, "That is not right. That is
misinformation, because it hasn't been 5 or 7 or 8 minutes that I left him in
his presence and he was very much alive then." And just then they kept
talking on the radio, and I got to listening, and sure enough, they shot him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was your car parked? Was it parked in the basement
where they were going to transfer Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; out on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, did you ever talk to Captain Fritz or any police officer about
Oswald getting shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I haven't talked or discussed this in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Not since then with any other police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything said in that interrogation of Lee Harvey
Oswald pertaining to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. When I was discussing with him about rental application for
Box No. 6225 at the terminal annex, I asked him if he had shown that anyone
else was entitled to get mail in that box and he said, "No."</p>

<p>I said, "Who did you show as your&mdash;what did you show as your business?</p>

<p>And he said, "I didn't show anything."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, your box rental application here says, 'Fair Play for Cuba
Committee and the American Civil Liberties Union'."</p>

<p>Well, he said, "Maybe that is right, I did put them on there."</p>

<p>I said, "Did they, anyone, who paid for the box?"</p>

<p>He said, "I paid for it out of my own personal money."</p>

<p>"Did you rent it in the name of these organizations?"</p>

<p>And he said, "No."</p>

<p>He said, "I don't know why I put it on." He wouldn't talk about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk about whether he believed in the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; we didn't get into that. We did discuss the organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
of it in New Orleans, and I got the impression that Captain Fritz was trying
to get out of him the fact that he was the head man or the president of it, and
he kept evading that and would be real evasive. But finally he admitted that
he was, he said, "Actually, it was a loosely organized thing and we had no
officers, but probably you could call me the secretary of it because I did collect
money." In other words, "Secretary-Treasurer, because I did try to collect a
little money to get literature and work with."</p>

<p>Then I asked&mdash;oh, he mentioned, too, he said, "In New York they have a well
organized or a better organization."</p>

<p>Well, I asked him, or one of us asked him about, "Is that why you came to
Dallas, to organize a cell of this organization in Dallas?" And he said, "No,
not at all."</p>

<p>"Did you work on it or intend to organize here in Dallas?</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I didn't. I was too busy trying to get a job." That is about
all he said about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone say anything about Oswald saying anything about
his leaving the Texas School Book Depository after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He said, as I remember, actually, in answer to questions there,
he mentioned that when lunchtime came, one of the Negro employees asked
him if he would like to sit and each lunch with him, and he said, "Yes, but I
can't go right now." He said, "You go and take the elevator on down." No,
he said, "You go ahead, but send the elevator back up."</p>

<p>He didn't say up where, and he didn't mention what floor he was on. Nobody
seemed to ask him.</p>

<p>You see, I assumed that obvious questions like that had been asked in previous
interrogation. So I didn't interrupt too much, but he said, "Send the elevator
back up to me."</p>

<p>Then he said when all this commotion started, "I just went on downstairs."
And he didn't say whether he took the elevator or not. He said, "I went down,
and as I started to go out and see what it was all about, a police officer stopped
me just before I got to the front door, and started to ask me some questions,
and my superintendent of the place stepped up and told the officers that I am
one of the employees of the building, so he told me to step aside for a little
bit and we will get to you later. Then I just went on out in the crowd to see
what it was all about."</p>

<p>And he wouldn't tell what happened then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say where he was at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He just said he was still up in the building when the commotion&mdash;he
kind <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he gesture with his hands, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He talked with his hands all the time. He was handcuffed, but
he was quiet&mdash;well, he was not what you call a stoic phlegmatic person. He is
very definite with his talk and his eyes and his head, and he goes like that, you
see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Oswald say anything about seeing a man with a crewcut in
front of the building as he was about to leave it? Do you remember anything
about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't remember anything about that. Did he say anything
about telling a man about going to a pay phone in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Policeman rushed&mdash;I take it back&mdash;I don't know whether he said
a policeman or not&mdash;a man came rushing by and said, "Where's your telephone?"</p>

<p>And the man showed him some kind of credential and I don't know that he
identified the credential, so he might not have been a police officer, and said
I am so and so, and shoved something at me which I didn't look at and said,
"Where is the telephone?"</p>

<p>And I said, "Right there," and just pointed in to the phone, and I went on out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Oswald say why he left the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; other than just said he talked about this commotion and
went out to see what it was about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Oswald say how he got home, if he did get home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. They didn't&mdash;we didn't go into that. I just assumed that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
had covered all that. Nobody asked him about from the minute he walked out
the door as to what happened to him, except somebody asked him about the
shooting of Tippit, and he said, "I don't know what you are talking about."</p>

<p>He said, "The only thing that I am in here for is because I popped a policeman
in the nose in a threatre on Jefferson Avenue, which I readily admit I did,
because I was protecting myself."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Because he was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. "Protecting myself."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I want you now to take a look for the first time during our
interview here at Holmes Deposition Exhibit 4, and thus far you have been
testifying just from memory, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I notice that it starts out, that it is in an informal memorandum
that you put together, and then the second paragraph you have the
general impression that Oswald appeared confused or in doubt.</p>

<p>I wonder if you would read that second paragraph and see if there is anything
that you remember to elaborate on at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Read it aloud or to myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No; to yourself, and see if there is anything you can remember
to elaborate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. The only part I have not covered would be the impression that
I received that he had disciplined his mind and his reflexes to a point where I
doubt if he would even have been a good subject to a polygraph test, a lie
detector.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you would care to elaborate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I wonder then if you would take a look at the second paragraph
that begins "P.O. Boxes."</p>

<p>That is really the third paragraph on the page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; I think I have, if I remember that pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you take a look at the next paragraph, which is the last
paragraph on the first page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe there would be nothing to elaborate or change on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Turn to page 2 on the first paragraph of the next page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. The only thing there that I haven't covered would be that the
reason these various post office boxes wherever he went was that it was much
easier to have his mail reach him through post office forwarding orders than
it was to try to get somebody over in Russia to change the address on a newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, did he talk about anything at all about his life in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He mentioned only that he met his wife in Minsk. That was her
home town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It seemed like it was a dance. He met her at a dance, he told us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That he took these two local newspapers for her benefit, because
it was local news to her and that was the reason he was getting those papers.
She enjoyed reading about the home folks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about Russia? Did he ever say anything about
going to Mexico? Was that ever covered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes. To the extent that mostly about&mdash;well&mdash;he didn't spend,
"Where did you get the money?" He didn't have much money and he said it
didn't cost much money. He did say that where he stayed it cost $26 some odd,
small ridiculous amount to eat, and another ridiculous small amount to stay all
night, and that he went to the Mexican Embassy to try to get this permission to
go to Russia by Cuba, but most of the talks that he wanted to talk about was how
he got by with a little amount.</p>

<p>They said, "Well, who furnished you the money to go to Mexico?"</p>

<p>"Well, it didn't take much money." And it was along that angle, was the
conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he admit that he went to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say what community in Mexico he went to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Mexico City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say what he did while he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He went to the Mexican consulate, I guess.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, with regard to this Mexican trip, did he say who he saw
in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Only that he went to the Mexican consulate or Embassy or something
and wanted to get permission, or whatever it took to get to Cuba. They
refused him and he became angry and he said he burst out of there, and I don't
know. I don't recall now why he went into the business about how mad it made
him.</p>

<p>He goes over to the Russian Embassy. He was already at the American.
This was the Mexican&mdash;he wanted to go to Cuba.</p>

<p>Then he went to the Russian Embassy and he said, because he said then
he wanted to go to Russia by way of Cuba, still trying to get to Cuba and
try that angle and they refused and said, "Come back in 30 days," or something
like that. And, he went out of there angry and disgusted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he go to the Cuban Embassy, did he say or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He may have gone there first, but the best of my recollection,
it might have been Cuban and then the Russian, wherever he went at first,
he wanted to get to Cuba, and then he went to the Russian to go by Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say why he wanted to go to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did&mdash;this wasn't reported in your interview in the memorandum
that you wrote?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this something that you think you might have picked up from
just reading the papers, or is this something you remember hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is what he said in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right; I want to go back to page 2 of this memorandum.</p>

<p>I believe we went through the first paragraph on page 2 when you said that
there wasn't anything you cared to add there other than what is reported on
this Holmes Deposition Exhibit 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Except what he mentioned about it was easier about the forwarding
orders of newspapers. Otherwise, no change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, what about the next paragraph on page 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I think I have covered that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then. The next paragraph on page 2, which is the
third and last paragraph on the page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe I have mentioned the fact that he was evasive about
whether he was actually a member of the American Civil Liberties Union. In
this statement I have mentioned that he was evasive about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does that statement cover everything, or is there anything you
care to add to that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I can't think of anything of any particular importance there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then turn to page 3, the first paragraph. Is there anything
you can or care to add to that paragraph that isn't covered right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. All right as is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the second paragraph on page 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I have covered that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the third paragraph which begins with "Marine Corps
Service."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't believe that I discussed that yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You haven't discussed it, but is there anything you care to add
other than what is written on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he indicate anything else about Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No. I have covered that in there. In fact, I got the distinct
impression that he showed no flareup, no animosity when Connally's name was
mentioned. He simply considered him&mdash;somebody was shuffling the papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
around, and he had no particular animosity toward him. I remember that
distinctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he seem to have any animosity toward President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, take a look at the first paragraph on page 3 and read that
and see if there is anything you care to add to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the fifth paragraph on the page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I haven't discussed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything you would care to add to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No, sir. That is as he stated it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the last paragraph on page 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is as I recall it at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, in the last paragraph on page 3, it says that when asked
why he went to visit his wife on Thursday night, whereas he normally visited
her on the weekends, and he said on that particular weekend there was going
to be a party for children. They were having a house full of children and he
didn't want to be around at such a time. And, therefore, he made the weekly
visit on Thursday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone question him about curtain rods, that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was that about curtain rods?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Asked him if he brought a sack out when he got in the car
with this young fellow that hauled him and he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>"What was in the sack?"</p>

<p>"Well, my lunch."</p>

<p>"What size sack did you have?"</p>

<p>He said, "Oh, I don't know what size sack. You don't always get a sack
that fits your sandwiches. It might be a big sack."</p>

<p>"Was it a long sack?"</p>

<p>"Well, it could have been."</p>

<p>"What did you do with it?"</p>

<p>"Carried it in my lap."</p>

<p>"You didn't put it over in the back seat?"</p>

<p>"No." He said he wouldn't have done that.</p>

<p>"Well, someone said the fellow that hauled you said you had a long package
which you said was curtain rods you were taking to somebody at work and
you laid it over on the back seat."</p>

<p>He said, "Well, they was just mistaken. That must have been some other
time he picked me up."</p>

<p>That is all he said about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there any other questions asked about curtain rods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, I turn to the top of page 4, which is the next paragraph,
and I see that you have this recorded in your memorandum. You have
this all recorded here except you don't mention the sentence about the curtain
rods?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. So that has been elaborated on in that paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, anything else you care to elaborate on that first paragraph
on page 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, the second paragraph on page 4 pertaining to his
whereabouts at the time of the shooting. Would you care to elaborate on
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe it is just about as I have stated. No elaboration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then the third paragraph on page 4 was about an A.&nbsp;J. Hidell
identification card. Would you care to read that and see if there is anything on
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, where did this policeman stop him when he was
coming down the stairs at the Book Depository on the day of the shooting?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He said it was in the vestibule.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He said he was in the vestibule?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Or approaching the door to the vestibule. He was just coming,
apparently, and I have never been in there myself. Apparently there is
two sets of doors, and he had come out to this front part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he state it was on what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. First floor. The front entrance to the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything about a Coca Cola or anything like that,
if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Seems like he said he was drinking a Coca Cola, standing there
by the Coca Cola machine drinking a Coca Cola.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Nothing more than what I have already told you on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you care to add to the third paragraph on
page 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, here in the fourth paragraph, which is the last paragraph
of page 4, the last paragraph of your memorandum, anything else you care
to add to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that we haven't covered that you think
might be helpful here and you think we ought to talk about, Mr. Holmes?
Have you found now in your records the money order number that was
involved in the purchase of the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. The money order number that was found in Washington and
matched the original money order was number 2-202-130-462, issued at the
main office in Dallas, Tex., on March 12, 1963, in the amount of $21.45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any information on the money order for the pistol
or how the pistol was paid for, or was there a money order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mr. Holmes, I wonder if you could try and think if there
is anything else that you remember Oswald saying about where he was during
the period prior or shortly prior to, and then at the time of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Nothing more than I have already said. If you want me to
repeat that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go ahead and repeat it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. See if I say it the same way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He said when lunchtime came he was working in one of the
upper floors with a Negro.</p>

<p>The Negro said, "Come on and let's eat lunch together."</p>

<p>Apparently both of them having a sack lunch. And he said, "You go ahead,
send the elevator back up to me and I will come down just as soon as I am
finished."</p>

<p>And he didn't say what he was doing. There was a commotion outside,
which he later rushed downstairs to go out to see what was going on. He
didn't say whether he took the stairs down. He didn't say whether he took
the elevator down.</p>

<p>But he went downstairs, and as he went out the front, it seems as though he
did have a coke with him, or he stopped at the coke machine, or somebody else
was trying to get a coke, but there was a coke involved.</p>

<p>He mentioned something about a coke. But a police officer asked him who
he was, and just as he started to identify himself, his superintendent came
up and said, "He is one of our men." And the policeman said, "Well, you step
aside for a little bit."</p>

<p>Then another man rushed in past him as he started out the door, in this vestibule
part of it, and flashed some kind of credential and he said, "Where is your
telephone, where is your telephone, and said I am so and so, where is your
telephone."</p>

<p>And he said, "I didn't look at the credential. I don't know who he said he was,
and I just pointed to the phone and said, 'there it is,' and went on out the door."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Holmes, when we first met, we sat down and I practically
started taking testimony right away, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything in the short conversation we had before we
started taking testimony about this matter that we haven't discussed here on
the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For the record, I would like to offer as a part of this deposition
Holmes Exhibits 1, 2, 3, and 4, and in addition, I don't know for the record, but
I would like to offer&mdash;at some of the depositions we have had delays, but will
you have copies made, madam reporter?</p>

<p>And one final thing, you have the right, if you want, to come back and read the
deposition and sign, or else you let it go to us without signing or coming back
without reading it. Do you want to waive it or come back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I will waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. One other thing. I better mark this as Holmes Deposition,
Exhibit 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I want to save that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Holmes, I hand you Holmes Deposition Exhibit 5 and ask you
to state if you will what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It is a circular-type sheet simulating a wanted circular as put
out by the post office department or the FBI showing a profile view. That is
two separate views of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The one that says "Wanted for Treason"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Underneath his picture in large type is "Wanted for Treason."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you get ahold of this document, or what is the fact
involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. This was handed to me by one of the postal supervisors who
brought it to my office stating that it had been brought in by one of the carriers
that found it in a collection box on his route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what day, do you know, offhand, in relation to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He brought that in the afternoon of the assassination,
November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know how many of these were passed out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; except that it came from various sources. They were being
passed out at neighborhood shopping centers, and numerous of them were
brought in. This supervisor said that they had dozens of them down there, that
it had come in by the carrier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe you also said that&mdash;is there anything else in regards to
Holmes Deposition Exhibit 5 you care to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you showed us your deposition Exhibit 1, this application
for a post office box dated November 1, 1963, of Lee Harvey Oswald, and you
said this was at the terminal annex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How can you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Because I recognized it as being the application, and also&mdash;I mean
the application that I obtained at the terminal annex, and also the 6,000 designates
that series of boxes at the terminal annex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you also showed me an application for box 5475, dated
November 7, 1963. Is that also the terminal annex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This was taken out by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is an application taken out by Jack Ruby on November 7,
1963, showing his firm name as being Earl Products; business, merchandising.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We will put this as Holmes Deposition Exhibit 6. Do you know
of any connection of your own knowledge between Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No, sir; I know of none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can say about Holmes Deposition Exhibit 6?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Other than the fact that within a week of one another these two
applications were taken out at the same post office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is the only significance that it has, as far as I am
concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We will offer in evidence Holmes Deposition Exhibits 5 and 6,
in addition to 1 through 4.</p>

<p>Let the record show that the original of Holmes Deposition Exhibit 5 will be
returned to Mr. Holmes, and we will just for our records have copies made by
the court reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I have a photocopy machine in my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Holmes, you have also asked me to make a photostatic copy of
Holmes Deposition Exhibit 2 and you keep the original. This would be satisfactory
for our purposes. This is the advertisement you cut out. Do you suppose
you could get this to the court reporter yourself? Would you take the
photostats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Holmes, we want to certainly thank you for all the cooperation
you have given the President's Commission.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t308">TESTIMONY OF JAMES W. BOOKHOUT</h2>

<p>The testimony of James W. Bookhout was taken at 11:15 a.m., on April 8,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Will you please rise.</p>

<p>Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Sit down, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. State your name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. James W. Bookhout. Do you want my home address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. 7048 Cornelia Lane, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Bookhout?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long have you been with the Federal Bureau of Investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Little over 22 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long have you been assigned to the Dallas office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Since about 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you on duty on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Actually, I was on leave on that particular date. However,
I had been requested to come to the office to handle some expedited dictation in
a particular case. Having completed that, I left the office and proceeded to the
Mercantile National Bank, where I transacted some personal business. Upon
leaving the bank, it was momentarily expected that the President's motorcade
would pass that area. I stood there for a few minutes, and as the motorcade
passed I was actually unable to personally observe the President, due to the
crowd on the sidewalk. While waiting for the crowd to thin, in order to cross
the street, several separate sirens on the police squad cars were heard proceeding
in the direction of the county courthouse. While crossing the street,
some citizen with a transistor radio stated that it had just been announced that
shots had been fired at the President's motorcade.</p>

<p>I immediately proceeded toward the office and observed two agents coming
from the direction of the office, who advised that the office was trying to contact
me and I was to proceed to the homicide and robbery bureau of the Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
I immediately proceeded to the homicide and robbery bureau and contacted
my office and was advised that I was to maintain liaison with the homicide
and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you then go to the police headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes; as I said, I went to the homicide and robbery bureau
after contacting the Dallas office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What then occurred at the police headquarters? Let me ask you
this: How soon after you arrived there was Oswald brought in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, it was some little time, as I recall, the next pertinent
instance was a report that the Dallas Police officer had been shot, and that was
in the Oak Cliff area. Captain Fritz had not returned to the office at that time.
When he did return, and subsequently Oswald was apprehended in the Texas
Theatre, information was passed to Captain Fritz as to the name of the suspect
that they had apprehended on the Tippit shooting, and at that time he stated
that that was the suspect that they were looking for on the killing of the
President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did the name Lee Harvey Oswald mean anything to you at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No. Captain Fritz went on to explain that Oswald was an
employee of the Texas Book Depository, who they had ascertained left his
employment there subsequent to the shooting incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And sometime after this he was brought to the police headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you present when he was brought in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you describe his physical condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I can recall one of the officers that brought him in was
Paul Bentley. He is a polygraph operator in the identification division of the
Dallas Police Department, and Bentley was limping, and Oswald had one
eye that was swollen and a scratch mark on his forehead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you observe any other bruises?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he walking by himself, or being held by police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. To my recollection there was an officer on each side of him that
had ahold of his arms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he struggling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; just walking in, you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. In a normal fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then what occurred, that you observed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I believe he was taken directly into Captain Fritz' office
and the interview started at that time with Captain Fritz, and two homicide
officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I was not in the office at that time. I called our office, advised
them he had been brought in, and that the interview was starting and
shortly thereafter Mr. Shanklin, our SAC called back and said the Bureau
wanted the agents present in the interview and that Hosty, James P. Hosty, I believe
was to sit in on the interview, and I was to also be present with Hosty.
So, at that time, we asked Captain Fritz to sit in on the interview, and that
was approximately 3:15 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long had the interview gone on before you were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Very shortly. I would give a rough estimate of not more
than 5 to 10 minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long did that first interview last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. A little under an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was it interrupted at any point, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, what I am thinking, we have got several interviews
here. I know from time to time I can't recall whether it was this interview,
or subsequent interviews Captain Fritz would have to leave the office for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
second or two. By "office," I mean the immediate office that the interview
was being conducted in, but still within the homicide and robbery office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did the interviewing continue when he was out of the room, or did
you wait for his return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; it would continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. By whom was the interview conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Primarily it was conducted by Captain Fritz and then
before he would leave from one point to another he would ask if there was
anything we wanted to ask him particularly on that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. By "we," you mean Agent Hosty and yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was Oswald's demeanor in the course of this interview?
Did he seem in control of himself, excited, or calm? Can you describe his
conduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He was very arrogant and argumentative. That is about
the extent of the comment on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is this as to you and Hosty, or also Captain Fritz? Did he
differentiate in his conduct between Captain Fritz and the two of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Now&mdash;no; that would apply to everyone present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he answer all questions put to him or did he refuse to
answer the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; there would be certain questions that he refused to
comment about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When this happened was the question pressed, or another question
asked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Anyone asking the&mdash;another question would be asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What sort of question would he refuse to answer? Was there
any pattern to his refusing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, now, I am not certain whether this would apply then
to this particular interview, the first interview or not, in answering this, but
I recall specifically one of the interviews asking him about the Selective Service
card which he had in the name of Hidell, and he admitted that he was carrying
the card, but that he would not admit that he wrote the signature of Hidell on
the card, and at that point stated that he refused to discuss the matter further.
I think generally you might say anytime that you asked a question that would
be pertinent to the investigation, that would be the type of question he would
refuse to discuss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you say he had a pretty good idea of what might be
incriminating and what not incriminating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, I think that would call for an opinion, and I can only
report the facts to you, and based on the example of the type of questions that
I had commented on that he refused to answer, you will have to draw your own
conclusion on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine. I am just trying to get at whether he seemed in command
of himself and alert, and whether he handled himself responsibly from his own
viewpoint, but if you don't want to venture an opinion, that's fine.</p>

<p>When you first joined the interview, did you advise him that you were an
agent of the FBI, and did you say anything about warning him that evidence&mdash;that
anything he said might be used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes; that was done by Agent Hosty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he, at that point, or later say anything specifically regarding
the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Tell us what that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He accused the FBI of, generally, unfair tactics in interviewing
his wife on some previous occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was this directed specifically at either you or Hosty, or to the
<span class="locked">general&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. It was directed against Hosty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. He did not, Oswald did not indicate that he knew Hosty himself,
did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But, there was a complaint about an interview, or interrogation
of Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he say anything about FBI interviews of him that had occurred
in the past, any complaint about such interviews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I don't know that that would be in this particular interview,
but in one of the interviews which has been reported he stated that he
had been interviewed at Fort Worth, Tex., by agents upon his return to the
United States from Russia, and he felt that they had used unfair means of
interviewing him, or something. Those are not his exact words, but that is
the impression he conveyed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Unfair in what respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Tell us the nature of his complaint.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I think he probably used the expression, "Unfair tactics,"
or something in their interviews.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes. Did he indicate that he felt that the interview that was
then going on was unfair in any way? Did he complain about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No, he didn't complain about the interview. He made a complaint
or two, as I recall, that one of the interviews that has been reported,
in fact, I believe it was in this first interview he complained about his hands
being handcuffed behind his back, and asked Captain Fritz to remove the
handcuffs. Captain Fritz had one of his officers uncuff his hands from behind
his back and recuff them in front and asked him if that was more satisfactory
and he stated that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Any other aspect of his treatment that he complained of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I recall one of the interviews that he complained about the
lineup that he was in, that he wasn't allowed to wear a jacket similar to
jackets worn by others in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did this occur at the lineup or subsequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. This was in one of the interviews in Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Referring to a lineup that <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Subsequently been held&mdash;previously been held.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. During the first interview was he asked whether he had ever
been in Mexico, and if so, by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes; I recall Hosty asking him if he had ever been in
Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He said he had not. I believe he mentioned he had been in
Tijuana, Mexico, I believe, but I believe the question was whether he had ever
been in Mexico City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he asked about an organization called the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee, and if so, by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes, he was asked if he belonged to that. I don't recall
specifically who raised the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He said he was a member of it, and was secretary of the
New Orleans branch. I believe he said the headquarters was in New York
City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was there much discussion of this, or just the identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, now, that is another instance where he balked on
answering a question. He was asked who the officers were, and at that
point he said he refused to discuss the matter further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he asked his residence address in Dallas and did he give it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes; he furnished the address of 1026 North Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he say that he was living there under another name, or was
another name and particularly the name O.&nbsp;H. Lee mentioned at all in this
connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He was asked why he was using the name Lee at this address,
and he attempted to pass it off by stating that the landlord was an old lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
and his first name was Lee and she just had gotten it in her head that he
was Mr. Lee. He never did explain about the initials O. H.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he asked whether he had shot the President, or Officer
Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes; he was asked that, and denied shooting either one of
them, or knowing anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he asked whether he was carrying a pistol at the time he
was in the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes; that was brought up. He admitted that he was carrying
a pistol at the time he was arrested. He claimed that he had bought this
some time ago in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. He said he had gotten it in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That is my recollection, and there again, in trying to follow
through on that line of thought, he refused to answer any further questions as
to whereabouts in Fort Worth he had bought it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he talk about his arrest and his resistance of arrest at the
Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He admitted fighting with the officer at the time of the arrest,
but I don't recall any explanation as to why he was doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he admit that he might have been wrong in doing that, or
say anything to that effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Seemed to me like he made the comment that the only thing
he was guilty of, or the only thing he could be charged with would be the
carrying of a concealed weapon, and of resisting the arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When he was asked about involvement in the assassination of
President Kennedy, or the shooting of Officer Tippit, how would you describe
his denials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, I don't know exactly how to describe it, but as I recall,
he spoke very loudly. In other words, he was&mdash;he gave an emphatic denial, that
is about all I can recall on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I believe that in the report you filed on this first interview, you
or Agent Hosty, who joined in the report with you, used the adverb "frantically"
to describe his denial of an involvement. Does that refresh your recollection
as to that? Would you use that word now, or was that your word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; that was written by Hosty, and that would be his expression
of describing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you think "emphatically," is perhaps the more descriptive word
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, that would be the way I would describe it. As I said,
he <span class="locked">spoke&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I am not trying to put words into your mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He spoke loudly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I am most interested in getting the tone of this interrogation and
his state, the way he conducted himself, and that is why I ask this question,
and there is something of a difference between saying a man is acting frantically
as opposed to his acting emphatically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, I suppose the word, "frantically," would probably describe
it. In other words, I said that he spoke loudly. There just wasn't a normal
type of denial. He was&mdash;it was more than that. That is the reason I say
that probably "frantically," might be a descriptive word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did that occur only in connection with questions about whether
he had shot the President, or was the general tone of this interrogation, as
far as he was concerned, at that level?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; he wouldn't use the same expression of speech in answering
all questions. He would have certain kinds there, and certain types
of questions that he would apparently have stronger feelings on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall at any time his pounding on the desk, or making
any other physical gestures of that kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I don't recall him pounding on the desk; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, this interview, as I understand, took approximately an hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. According to this report, you and Agent Hosty entered the interviewing
around about 3:15 p.m., and it ended at 4:05.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That would be correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were these times that you or Hosty would have recorded at that
moment in the ordinary course of your participation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That's correct. There was no log made of it, as such, but
those were the times recorded for that particular interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Your normal practice is to get times down pretty accurately in
matter of <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Try to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And did you make the record of these times, or did Agent Hosty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I can say that I did. Whether he did or not, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Incidentally, normally, do you preserve those notes or destroy
them when you make a formal report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. They will be, normally, destroyed at the time you make
your&mdash;what we refer to as an interview report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And in this case, did you destroy your notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So, you have no notes respecting this whole matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No, other than the reported interviewing report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes; when the first interview was concluded, it was, as I understand
it, to take Oswald before a lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you go with the police taking Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; I didn't go with them. In other words, it was strictly,
as far as we were concerned, a police operation. I did proceed to the lineup
room and observed it for the purpose of maintaining our liaison and keeping
up with what was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall how many people were in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. It was a four-man lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you know any of the other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall now their physical characteristics, as related
to Oswald's physical characteristics? Were they same size as he, or noticeably
larger or smaller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I observed that the lineup consisted of four men who were
numbered from left to right, one through four. Oswald was No. 2 in the
lineup. All the individuals appeared to be of the same general age, height,
and weight, and they were white American males.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What about the dress of all the people in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I cannot recall specifically what the dress was, but there
was nothing obviously different between their dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. From your experience as an FBI agent, from your experience in
policework, I take it you observed nothing about this lineup that was out of
the ordinary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you hear what the witnesses who were present at the lineup
said about the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When the lineup was concluded, what happened next, as far
as you were concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I returned to the homicide and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was Oswald brought back there, or taken elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I don't recall specifically whether he was brought back to
the homicide and robbery bureau, or placed in jail, but I do know that I didn't
interview him any more that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you have any further contact with him that day? Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When did you next see Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, it would be on the morning of November 23, 1963,
in the homicide and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This was another interrogation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Conducted by Captain Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall who else was present, and you may refer any time
to your reports to refresh your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. All right; that will be the interrogation that was in the
presence of myself, T.&nbsp;J. Kelley of the U.S. Secret Service, David B. Grant,
U.S. Secret Service, Robert I. Nash, U.S. marshal, and Detectives Billy L.
Senkel and Fay M. Turner from the homicide and robbery bureau, Dallas
Police Department. This interview was conducted, primarily, by Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you ask any questions in the course of this interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What were they, and what were the responses, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. One specific question was with regard to the selective service
card in the possession of Oswald bearing a photograph of Oswald and the name
Alek James Hidell. Oswald admitted he carried this selective service card, but
declined to state that he wrote the signature of Alek J. Hidell appearing on
same. Further declined to state the purpose of carrying same, and&mdash;or any
use he made of same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did Oswald say anything in the course of this interview with
regard to obtaining a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes, it was in this interview that he mentioned he wanted
to contact Attorney Abt [spelling] A-b-t, New York City. I recall Captain Fritz
asked him if he knew Abt personally and he said he did not, but he explained
that he knew that Abt had defended the Smith Act cases in 1949, or 1950, and
Captain Fritz asked him if he knew how to get ahold of Mr. Abt, and he stated
that he did not know what his address was, but he was in New York.</p>

<p>I recall that Captain Fritz explained to him that he would allow him to place
a long distance call for Abt, and he explained to Oswald how to ask the long
distance operator to trace him down and locate him, even though Oswald didn't
even know his address or telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he actually make the call in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; he didn't make the call in my presence. The next interview
that we had with him, I recall that Captain Fritz asked him if he had
been able to contact Mr. Abt. Oswald stated that he had made the telephone
call and thanked Captain Fritz for allowing him to make the call, but actually,
he had not been able to talk to Abt. He wasn't available. Wasn't in his office
or <span class="locked">something&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he complaining about not having counsel furnished, or did he
seem satisfied with the effort to reach Abt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; he made no complaint about not being furnished an attorney.
Actually, there was a good deal of conversation on that point, and he
stated that he did not want any Dallas attorney representing him, and said that
if he couldn't get in touch with Mr. Abt, that he would probably contact someone
with the Civil Liberties Union, and have them furnish an attorney. I recall
sometime during November 22 or 23, I believe it was, the head of the Dallas Bar
Association appeared at the homicide and robbery bureau and requested permission
to talk to Oswald. Captain Fritz gave him that permission, and when
he got through talking to Oswald and came back in and told Captain Fritz that
he had seen him, and that Oswald did not want anybody from Dallas to represent
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You heard this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes; that was in my presence. I don't recall the name of the
attorney, but I was there at the time or during that conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you tell us approximately how long this Saturday morning
interview took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, that would be approximately an hour. No interview that
I participated in lasted over an hour, and I think roughly this one probably
started around 10:35 in the morning and lasted for approximately an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right. What was his physical appearance at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. His appearance was no different than it was on the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You saw no other bruises?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he seem rested, or tired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I saw no difference in his appearance on the 23d than it was
on the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How about the way he handled himself? Was he any calmer, any
more communicative Saturday morning than he had been Friday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Well, I think that he might not have been quite as belligerent
on the 23d as he was on the 22d. But he still refused to discuss certain points
indicated above, selective service card being one point that I recall. I remember
he was asked if he would take a polygraph, and he said he would not, that it
had always been his practice not to agree to take a polygraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he suggest that he had been asked before to take a polygraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He made some comment along the line that it had never been
his policy&mdash;before, to take a polygraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But he didn't elaborate on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He didn't elaborate on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he make any further comment at this interview about his
interviews with the FBI, or their interviews of his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I think probably this is the one I referred to a while ago. Yes,
it would be in this interview that he made further comment that on the interview
of Ruth Paine by the FBI, regarding his wife, that he felt that his wife
was intimidated. Also, in this interview that he made mention as previously
stated above that he had arrived about July 19, 1962, from Russia, and was
interviewed by the FBI at Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>He stated that he felt that they had overstepped their bounds and used various
tactics in interviewing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he specify what the tactics were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In your report before this interview you mentioned that he again
denied shooting President Kennedy, and apparently said that he didn't know
until then that Governor Connally had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That's correct. That was his statement, that he denied shooting
President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and commented that he
did not know that Governor John Connally had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you form any impression about whether he was genuinely
surprised? Did he look genuinely surprised to you, or how did you feel about
that? I am just asking for your impression. If you don't have one, say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; I have no impression on that. I arrived at no conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did he say at this interview with respect to the purchase of
a rifle, or possession of a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Generally, he stated that he didn't own a rifle, hadn't ever
made any mail order purchase of one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, did anything transpire that you observed concerning Oswald
between the end of that morning interview on Saturday, and the next interview
of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You stayed at the police headquarters in that period performing
liaison functions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You did not observe another lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; there were other lineups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But you did not participate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. But I did not observe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Or observe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Any others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, approximately when did the next interview occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. The interview at about 6:30 p.m., on November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long did this interview last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Not over an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Who conducted this interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you ask any questions, that you recall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I don't recall asking any specific questions during this interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It was at this interview, was it not, that Oswald was shown
photographs of himself holding a rifle and wearing a pistol in a holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was his comment about the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. His comment, as I recall, he was asked if this was his photograph,
and his comment was that the head of the photograph was his, but that
it could have been superimposed over the body of someone else. He pointed
out that he had been apparently photographed by news media numerous times
in proceeding from the homicide and robbery bureau to the lineup and back,
and that is how they probably got the photograph of his face, and he went
into a long discussion of how much he knew about photography, and knew that
this&mdash;his face could be superimposed over somebody else's body holding the gun
and pistol and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, was his appearance and demeanor at this <span class="locked">interview&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No different than it was during the previous interviews.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he have any comment at this interview about counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. None other than at the outset of being first asked if that
was his photograph, he first made the statement that he wouldn't make any
comment about it without the advice of counsel, but then subsequently is when
he went into the story about his face had been superimposed over somebody
else's body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he complain in the course of this interview about the way
in which the lineup had been conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. This is the interview in which he&mdash;a previously mentioned
comment here was made to the effect that he had not been granted a request
to put on a jacket similar to those worn by some of the other individuals in
some previous lineups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In each of these interviews was he generally taken through the
same questions or similar questions, or were the interviews addressed to different
areas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. More or less, they had been to a specific area. For instance,
in this last interview we are talking about, that was more or less confined to
this photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes. Did he ever complain that, "We have been over that ground
before," or make any such statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; I don't recall anything along that line, but I can recall
one subject matter probably in the first interview where he talked about his
method of transportation after leaving the Texas Book Depository, having
gotten on a bus, and then that subject was taken up again, as I recall, in the
second interview, expressed the same answer at that time, and then subsequently
to that interview he backed up and said that it wasn't actually true as
to how he got home. That he had taken a bus, and due to the traffic jam he
had left the bus and got a taxicab, by which means he actually arrived at his
residence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Had he been confronted by the driver of the taxicab, or been
told that they had located the driver of the taxicab before he changed his
story, or did he volunteer the story of the taxi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I don't recall specifically whether he was confronted with
that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right. Do you recall whether in the course of any of the
interrogations any official, anyone present suggested in any way to Oswald
that things would be better for him if he told the truth, if he confessed?
Was he ever offered any inducement&mdash;any suggestion made that he would be
better off if he told the full story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I can't recall anything along that line. I don't recall any type
of inducement whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In each interview in which you participated, did you warn him
about the possible use of his statement against him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I personally did not at each interview, but I can say that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
each interview he was warned. He was warned numerous times by Captain Fritz
and his rights were fully explained to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What sort of warning would Captain Fritz give him, generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. He gave a warning consisting of the fact that he did not have
to make any statement, that any statement he made could be used against him
in court, and he had the right to consult with an attorney, generally, that was
the rights that were explained to him, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This was said at each session at which you were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. This was given at once each time, and the question would
come up later on, I mean, he would repeat himself, that, you don't have to make
any statement&mdash;and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you observe anytime any physical or mental coercion of
Oswald by anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, back on the record. This interview on late Saturday afternoon,
was about 6 or 6:30, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. This one started about 6:30 p.m. And I would say it lasted
about an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I see. So, that is 7:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was there any further interview that day that you participated
in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. None that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you see Oswald again anytime after that interview concluded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Now, yes; on the morning of November 24, 1963, I observed
him in interview with Captain Fritz and numerous other officers in the homicide
and robbery bureau. Captain Fritz&mdash;I did not participate in this interview. It
had already started before I arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you notice anything unusual about his appearance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you see Oswald again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I stayed there in the office of the homicide and robbery bureau.
When I refer to "office" I mean the overall office, and inside of that office is a
private office of Captain Fritz. The interview was being conducted in the
private office. There is a glass partition or glass&mdash;well, say glass partition on
one side of the office that you can see what is going on inside there. I took a
seat adjacent to this glass area in the office proper of the homicide and robbery
bureau, and watched Oswald during the interview that was going on. About&mdash;well,
I don't know what time specifically, it was after 11 o'clock, as I recall, the
interview terminated. I asked Captain Fritz if he had&mdash;if Oswald made any
admissions, and he stated that he had not made any. Shortly thereafter he was
taken out of the homicide and robbery bureau. I remained in the homicide office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you see him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Next time I saw him was after a report came out over the
intercom system for any homicide and robbery officers to report to the city hall
basement. I proceeded to the basement after learning from Lieutenant Baker
in the homicide and robbery bureau, who had made a telephone call to the dispatcher
to inquire what was going on, that Oswald had been shot.</p>

<p>When I arrived in the basement I asked where was Oswald, and they said
that he was in the jail office. I asked who had shot him, and I was told an
individual by the name of Jack Ruby. I asked where he was. They said, they
have already taken him up to the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Just shortly thereafter the ambulance came, and I observed
them roll Oswald out of the jail office on the stretcher and that is the <span class="locked">last&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I would like to clear up one point, Mr. Bookhout, about the number
of interviews on Saturday. Your present recollection is that there were how
many in which you participated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. Two on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. One at about what time and the other at what time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. One was about 10:35 a.m., and the second one was about
6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You do not now recall any separate interview at about 12:30 on
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I don't specifically recall any separate interview at that time.
I checked the record before coming over and the interviews that I have mentioned
are the only ones I have in the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you describe briefly the conditions in the corridor outside
the homicide and robbery area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. On November 22 and 23, the hallway in front of the homicide
and robbery bureau located on the third floor of the city hall building was
jammed with news media. From the elevator area to the end of the hallway,
extending on past the homicide and robbery bureau entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Could you hear anything from the hallway when you were in the
interrogation room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. No; there were two Dallas Police officers on duty at the
entrance to the homicide and robbery bureau, who required you to identify yourself
being that&mdash;before being allowed entrance into the bureau. The interviews
of Oswald were conducted in the private offices of Capt. J.&nbsp;W. Fritz, located
within the same bureau, and the door to the private office was closed, and we
did not hear any commotion going on outside in the halls while the interviews
were in progress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did Oswald ever say anything that you heard about the press
and conditions in the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. The only thing I recall offhand is the incident mentioned previously
about the press undoubtedly taking his photograph when he was going
and coming from the homicide and robbery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I think that covers all the questions I have, Mr. Bookhout. Thank
you very much for coming here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. You are welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. If there is anything that occurs to you that I haven't asked about
and you think the Commission should know, I would be delighted to have you
tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I can't think of anything that I could add to what you have
already heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, our reporter will transcribe your testimony and can make a
copy available for you to read and sign. If you think it is accurate, you can
waive that if you desire, and she will then send it directly to the Commission.
It makes no difference at all to the Commission which you elect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. I think that as far as I am concerned, it would be all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine. Then you will waive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. My idea&mdash;the purpose&mdash;only purpose I would have would be
just to help you if there are any typographical errors in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine. And thank you for coming in today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bookhout</span>. All right.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t318">TESTIMONY OF MANNING C. CLEMENTS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Manning C. Clements was taken at 10:15 a.m., on April 8,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Good morning, Mr. Clements. Will you rise and raise your right
hand, please.</p>

<p>Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you please sit down. State your name and address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Manning C. Clements, 5542 Montrose [spelling] M-o-n-t-r-o-s-e
Drive, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Clements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I'm a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long have you been a member of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Twenty-three years and approximately 4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long have you been assigned to the Dallas office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Since April 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you on duty as a special agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did your duties that morning before noon concern the visit of
the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Will you relate to us what happened when you first heard the news
of the shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I arrived at the office following lunch and shortly thereafter
heard of the shooting at the motorcade, and my superior instructed me to go to
the office of the chief of police. I was to offer the services of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation for whatever use the police might find them of benefit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I went to the police station, arriving there at approximately
1 o'clock. I immediately contacted the office of the chief. I found that he was
out. I contacted Capt. Glen King, his administrative assistant, and Captain
Lunday, who was also on duty in the chief's office. Contacted Art Hammet, the
public relations representative, who was occupying the desk in the outer office
of the chief. I informed each of them as to the reason for my presence and
that any requests that they might have for FBI assistance, information or
otherwise, could be given to me and I would in turn, relay their request to our
Dallas office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What occurred next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. During the course of the next several hours I was in occasional
contact with various representatives of the police department, in contact with
my own office by telephone. Served more or less as a liaison officer to relay
instructions to any other FBI agents who were on the premises.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When did you first hear of the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I can't fix the exact time. I am certain that I heard almost
immediately after the arrest, because I learned from police personnel of the
shooting of Officer Tippit, and thereafter, when they received radio reports, I
was generally aware of such report. So, I became aware of the arrest of
Oswald, I would say, approximately coincidentally with the front office, or
with the police department learning of the arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. At that time his name meant nothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Repeat that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. His name meant nothing to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you present when he was brought into the police headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When did you first see Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I am, at this moment, uncertain of whether I saw him prior to
personally interrogating him. I don't believe that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you know that he was being interrogated, and that other
special agents of the FBI were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. It was my understanding that he was being questioned and
that FBI agents were participating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You were, then, pursuing other functions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And they were, again, liaison activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Liaison&mdash;primarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you, Mr. Clements, the conduit for any information that the
FBI had concerning Oswald, to the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I understand that you participated in an interrogation of Oswald.
Would you tell me about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Sometime during the evening I did go to the homicide bureau
office for some purpose I don't immediately recall, and there I saw one of our
other agents, James Bookhout, and I asked him if anyone had, to his knowledge,
taken a detailed physical description and detailed background information from
Oswald. He told me that such description and background data had not been
obtained, and suggested that I do it. I learned from Bookhout, as I recall,
that Oswald was, at the time, in a small office, the door of which was closed.</p>

<p>I sought out Captain Fritz, in charge of the homicide bureau, or one of his
ranking officers and asked if there was any objection to my interviewing Oswald
in the regard mentioned.</p>

<p>I was told there was no objection. I entered this room and found that
Oswald was in the room, and being guarded by two officers who I presumed to
be members of the Dallas Police Department, but whom I did not personally
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. They were not interrogating him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No; they were apparently just sitting on guard duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I introduced myself to the officers whose names I do not
believe that I got, and also introduced myself to Oswald. Exhibited my credentials
and told him that I would like to obtain from him some physical description,
background, biographical data. He was agreeable, and I began my
interview with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you approximate the time of day that this occurred&mdash;roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I would say the interview began roughly at 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long did it last? And was it interrupted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I estimate the overall interview was approximately 30 or
35 minutes. I was interrupted twice, perhaps, during the interview, being
informed that he was being taken out for a lineup. While he was gone I
examined the contents of his wallet which was there on the desk, and identified
to me as Oswald's wallet. When he returned I continued the interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Approximately how long was he gone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I would estimate 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So, that the total amount of time that you spent with him was
something like 20 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. That would be a rough estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you see him again after that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Yes; I saw him next at a time which I estimate was 11:30
p.m., the 22d. It was at a time when he was being taken to the basement of
the city hall to a press conference. I saw him as he was being taken to the
third floor from the offices of the homicide bureau, and I went to the basement
myself arriving there before he did, and I saw him as he was being brought
into the room where the press conference was held, and during the course of
the press conference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you see him again at any time after that press conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was his physical condition, as you observed it when <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. <span class="locked">He&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you entered the room to interrogate him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I observed a bruise, a bruise in the vicinity of one of his
eyes. I believe minor scratches on his face. I saw no evidence that he was
suffering from any physical pain or anything of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. With his hands in front or behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Hands were in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he seem alert, or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. He seemed alert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Will you now tell, Mr. Clements, as much as you can recall of
your interrogation of Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I informed him of the purpose of my interview. He made
no objection. I proceeded to get his name in full. I asked him questions as
to his date and place of birth, height, weight, color of his hair and eyes, and
as to the existence of any permanent scars or marks. As to the identities of
close relatives, their addresses and occupations, and asked him as to his
own occupation, residence, attempting to get them in chronological order, and
asked as to his past occupations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you review with him the contents of his wallet and ask him
questions on any of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I questioned him as to the fictitious, and obviously fictitious
selective service card, which I found in his wallet. I recognized it as being
fictitious card from the fact that the photograph was mounted on the card,
and that there were obvious erasures in typing of information on the card
itself. The card was in the name of an Alek James Hidell, but bore the photograph
of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did he say about that card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. He declined to answer any questions as to the reason of his
possession of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were there any other questions you put to him that he refused
to answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Toward the conclusion of the interview and after he had been
absent and returned I continued with the questions of past residence and past
occupations. He responded to my questions. At a time when I asked him
as to his present occupation he hesitated and told me that he thought the obtaining
of his description and background information had become somewhat prolonged.
He said that he had refused to be interviewed by other law enforcement
officers previously, and that he had no intention of being interviewed by me.
He continued that he knew the tactics of the FBI. He stated there was a
counterpart or a similar agency in Russia, that I was using the soft touch,
where the approach of a Russian agency would be different, but the tactics
would be the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. At that point did he stop answering questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No; at that point I asked the same question that I had asked
previously, and he answered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did the interview continue beyond that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. That was substantially the end of the interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were there other persons present besides the two Dallas police
officers who were guarding him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. At either time, either before or after he had been withdrawn
from the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he seem hostile or resentful or irritated by the fact that
you were an FBI agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. He did not state that, if that were the case. He was courteous,
responsive as to any question. Volunteered little information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But volunteered very little information. Did he seem a person
in command of himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. He seemed to be in command of himself both physically and
mentally. He had what appeared to me to be a slightly haughty or arrogant
attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he complain to you about the treatment he was receiving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he say anything to you about obtaining counsel, whether he
had tried to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. He said nothing whatsoever in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he say anything about any effort on his part to reach his
family that had been unsuccessful?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. At the conclusion of your interview, did you leave the office in
which he was being guarded and leave him behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you next saw him at this press conference in the basement,
can you describe the conditions in that room? How many people were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. The corridor on the third floor was quite crowded, and when
I reached the basement there were, I would estimate, perhaps 50 people, all
told, including officers, members of the press, perhaps others. There was a
crowded condition I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Quite a great deal of noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I don't recall any great amount of noise. Although, I do recall
that members of the press were attempting to get Oswald to respond to questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How did he seem at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I saw no difference in his appearance to that at the time I had
talked with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he then seem to you to be in command of himself, and alert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Clements, did you make a record of your interview with
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How soon after the interview did you dictate that memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. The following day, November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And have you reviewed that memorandum to refresh your memory
of what occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you had no further contact, or didn't observe Oswald, Mr.
Clements, as I understand it, from the time of the press conference until he was,
himself, killed on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The reporter will transcribe your testimony. You can, if you
wish, review a copy of the transcript and sign it, or waive your signature and
the reporter will send it directly to the Commission, whichever you prefer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clements</span>. I think I would prefer to review it after it is typed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>The reporter will get in touch with you and give you an opportunity to
review it.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for coming in.</p>

<h2 id="t322">TESTIMONY OF GREGORY LEE OLDS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Gregory Lee Olds was taken at 4:05 p.m., on April 8, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you are about to give shall be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Sit down, please, Mr. Olds. For the record will you state your
name and address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Gregory Lee Olds, 1316 Timberlake, Richardson, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What is your profession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. I am an editor of a weekly newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. In Richardson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What is your connection with the Dallas Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. I am its President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you its president in November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you tell us what transpired on November 22, in connection
with your efforts and the efforts of your organization to assure that Lee Harvey
Oswald was not being denied his right to counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Yes. I got a phone call about 10:30 that night from one of our
board members saying they had been called by the President of the Austin
affiliate who was concerned about the reports that were being circulated on the
air. I think Oswald was directly quoted as saying he had not been given the
opportunity to have counsel, and the suggestion was made that it might be well
to check into this matter, and I believe I called this&mdash;I first called the police
department to inquire about this, and finally talked to Captain Fritz, Capt. Will
Fritz, and was&mdash;raised the question, and he said, "No&mdash;" that Oswald had been
given the opportunity and declined. And I called&mdash;then I called the board
member back who had called <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Excuse me. Did Captain Fritz say that Oswald did not want
counsel at that time, or that he was trying to obtain his own counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. What I was told, that he had been given the opportunity and had
not made any requests. So, I called our board member back and conferred
with him and he suggested that we go down and see about it at the police department,
in person, to get further assurances. And he and I and two others
of our organization met down there at the Plaza Hotel lobby about 11:15, directly
across the street from the police station, and we discussed the matter there, and
I called Mayor Earle Cabell at his office, but was told that he was busy at the
moment so we went then over to the police station, and we got in there. Let's
see, it was up on the&mdash;I guess the third or fourth floor, wherever Oswald was
being questioned, and Chuck Webster, a lawyer&mdash;professor of law, who was
known to the other three men with me said he had been there a good part of
the time since the assassination, and that&mdash;we told him what we were there
for, and he said he thought he knew who we could see to get our assurances.
Did you have something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. We went to&mdash;first, we talked&mdash;conferred with Captain King, I believe
is the right name, who is, I believe, assistant to the chief of police. I'm not
sure on that. We all went in with Mr. Webster, and this was shortly after
11:35, or 11:40, and Captain King was, at this time, talking to somebody and
said that Oswald had just been charged with the assassination of President
Kennedy. He had here&mdash;earlier been charged with the assassination&mdash;I mean
the murder of the policeman, Tippit, and we told Captain King what we were
there for, and he said, he assured us that Oswald had not made any requests
for counsel. And we went outside of the office and went downstairs, at least&mdash;I
didn't, but two of the others, I believe, went downstairs to the basement where
Justice of the Peace David Johnston was. He was the one that had held the&mdash;I
believe an arraignment, I believe is the right term, at 7:30 when the first
charge of murder was filed against Oswald, and he also assured us that there
had been an opportunity of&mdash;Oswald's rights had been explained, and he had
declined counsel. Said nothing beyond that. I think that was the extent of our
inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Also we were&mdash;I believe Chief Curry was quoted to us as having
said some&mdash;also that Oswald had been advised of his rights to counsel. I am
not sure who told me that. I believe that it was Mr. Webster. That was
about all. We felt fairly well satisfied that Oswald probably had not been deprived
of his rights, so, we then broke up. I think the other men went home,
and I went downstairs. I heard that there was going to be a press conference,
so I thought I could stand in on that and&mdash;do you want me to go ahead and
detail that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes, this <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. This was right at midnight, I think, when Oswald was brought in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Brought in where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. This was a squadroom and I am not sure what the term is. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
in the basement of the police station. That was being used as a pressroom. I
believe it is some sort of a classroom or something of that sort. He was
brought in there. I suppose a hundred reporters standing around on tables, and
I understand Ruby was there at the time, too, up near the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You don't know that, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. I don't remember seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you know Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. No; I don't. No; I remember someone saying what he was supposed
to have said when&mdash;and helped somebody answer a question. I forget
what it was, and Oswald came in, and he was there about 5 <span class="locked">minutes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you permitted to enter this room without displaying any
identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Yes; I wasn't stopped at all. Nobody seemed to pay&mdash;it was pretty
well confused around there, and nobody questioned me at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you have been known to the police as a newspaperman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. I had never been in the police building. No one had any way of
knowing who I was, or what my business was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you have to identify yourself to get into this building to
begin with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. No; no problem getting into the building. No one in the lobby,
and I don't believe there was anyone at all until you get up to the third or
fourth floor where the police department section of the building begins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What were the conditions of this room and the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Well, you mean the room where the press conference was held,
where Oswald came in? It was very noisy, and when Oswald came in it was
very confusing. The reporters were yelling at each other to get out of the
way, and they were, the photographers were having a very bad time with it, and
people kept crowding toward the front and standing on tables so that they
could see and hear and Oswald was there such a brief time, and was not able
to be heard beyond the first row of reporters who were circled around him.
Thereafter reporters were interviewing reporters who were on the front row to
see what had been said, and some sort of confusion existed, and enough of&mdash;oh,
probably 50 reporters standing around there, and it was a very confusing situation
it seemed. And Oswald had to be brought through the hall on his way from
the interrogation room to his cell, so, he couldn't avoid being seen, and it was at
this time that he was making the statements that were being quoted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you observe this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. No; I didn't. I saw this on television, but I could imagine it from
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How did he look to you when he was at this press conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. He looked remarkably composed and determined. He had a&mdash;I
remarked afterwards that I would have been very much distraught, and he
seemed very well self-contained and determined and maintained his innocence.
I heard that, and beyond that scratch above&mdash;on his forehead and the eye
that was swollen and the little&mdash;he looked all right.</p>

<p>He looked a little tired, of course, and I think his clothes were dirty, but
he looked remarkably in good shape, I thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did this give you any further assurance that&mdash;about the right
to counsel question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Possibly so, it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I don't want to put the idea in your head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Well, I know, but we had the idea that Oswald was not being
accurate when he said he had been denied, because in our dealings with the
police here, we have had reason to believe that they are very careful of this
sort of thing. And certainly in a case of this notoriety, certainly, our tendency
was to believe that, but I have always been sorry that we didn't talk with Oswald,
because it was not clear whether we would be permitted to see him that night
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But, you did not ask to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. No; we did not, which I think was a mistake on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did anything transpire on Saturday, November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Not so much. I was watching television most of the day and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
the matter of counsel was raised, I think, during that day. During the&mdash;I
suppose when Oswald was being transferred in the hall again, and&mdash;let's see&mdash;this
is when Mr. Nichols went down late this afternoon, I think around 5:30,
and he reported after that that he had seen Oswald in respect to the same
reasons that we had for going down there Saturday night, to see if he wanted
some sort of legal representation, and to make sure whether or not he was denied&mdash;being
denied it, and he said that he was satisfied that&mdash;in essence, Oswald
told Nichols he was satisfied with the situation. I can detail this conversation
if you would like, as it was told to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Well, that was the essence of what was found out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was there any mention of the American Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Yes; it was at this time that we first heard the idea that Oswald
might be a member of the American Civil Liberties Union, and this surprised
us, because we felt we would have had a record of it in our files, but there is
often a lapse of time when a member moves from one area to another and it
takes some time to transfer him to the local affiliate. To make sure of this
I called the national office in New York City, and it was night, of course there
was no one there, but I finally got a number of one of the staff members and
talked to him at his home in New Jersey and told him about it, and he said,
he would check on the matter. Have somebody in New York, who lived near
the office to go in and see about it, and he did and they found no such record at
that time.</p>

<p>However, it was later discovered that on November 4, he had sent a check
for $2 to the office, which was, I believe, discovered 3 weeks later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Olds, I think that covers the matters that I am interested in.
Is there anything further that you would like to tell us? Anything that
<span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. Possibly later after this matter was disposed of, we became
interested in the legal status of Oswald's wife, Marina, and a story in the New
York Times, I believe December 19, said something to the effect that perhaps
she was being held incommunicado and in some way illegally detained. Anyway,
her status was not clear as far as the reporter was concerned, and our national
office in New York City got a number of inquiries both by phone and personal
calls and letters, telegrams, and they asked us in turn then, to see what we
could find out about it. After a certain amount of negotiations with the Secret
Service and FBI and so on, we sent a letter to Mrs. Oswald and she later wrote
us that she was content with her situation, and was very happy with her
status, in fact, it was for her interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Olds for coming in today.</p>

<p>The reporter will transcribe your testimony and you will then be notified
when it is available and afforded an opportunity to read it and sign it. If you
would like to waive that that is possible and the reporter would send the transcript
directly to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. I will be glad to sign it. Do you want me to come down here and
do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. When do you think it might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It should be within the next week or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olds</span>. All right, fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What bars are you a member of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. State Bar of Texas, and admitted to practice in the Northern
District of Texas, Federal Court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What position do you presently hold with the Dallas Bar
Association?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I am a member of the board of directors for the Dallas Association,
at the present time. During 1963, I was President of the Dallas Bar
Association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. During the calendar year, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I see. Would you relate for us, Mr. Nichols, in your own words,
what occurred respecting Lee Harvey Oswald and your inquiry whether he
had the opportunity to avail himself of counsel during the period of his detention,
which began on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Sometime in the afternoon on Saturday the 23d of November,
as I best recall, in the neighborhood of about 2 o'clock, I received a phone call
from a lawyer friend of mine in Dallas who asked me if I knew whether or
not Mr. Oswald was represented by an attorney.</p>

<p>I told him I did not. He said he had received a phone call from an eastern
lawyer, dean of one of the law schools in the East, who told him that the news
media up there were saying that Oswald could not get a lawyer to represent
him in Dallas, and he wanted to know if I knew anything about the situation.
I told him I had not been following it too closely on television, because I was
out Friday and then out with my boy on Saturday morning and didn't know
really whether or not he had a lawyer.</p>

<p>And he said, well, that was the information he had received, and wanted to
know what I knew about it, and if he didn't have a lawyer, or wasn't able to
get one whether or not the bar association could, or would do anything about it.
I told him I didn't know what the situation was, but that I would be glad to
look into it, and&mdash;it had been less than 24 hours since Mr. Oswald had been
arrested. In order to refresh my memory as to what the requirement of the
State law is, and since I don't practice criminal law, I called a lawyer friend
of mine in Dallas who is a criminal lawyer and asked him just to tell me
offhand what the obligation was to appoint lawyers in criminal cases, if a
person did not have someone to represent him, and he told me that the obligation
was only to appoint counsel after a man had been indicted, and that, as
he understood it, since Mr. Oswald had not been indicted there was no legal
obligation to appoint an attorney.</p>

<p>I also received another call shortly thereafter from another lawyer friend
of mine in Dallas who said he had received a call from a dean of a law school.
One of the calls was from one dean of one law school. The other was from
another. I have forgotten which schools they were, and I don't remember which
called first with regard to the various deans, but he wanted to know from
me whether or not the bar association was doing anything. Whether Oswald
had a lawyer. And whether or not if he didn't have one, we should do anything
about getting him one, and I told him I had had a previous telephone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
call from another friend of mine, and that I had made some inquiry, and at
this time I did not know whether Oswald had a lawyer or was getting a lawyer,
but that I was going to make some inquiry to find out about it. After talking
to the second friend about it who called, I then called Mr. Henry Wade, the
district attorney, to see whether or not he knew whether or not Oswald was
represented by a lawyer or not.</p>

<p>I did not know for sure at that time whether he was, simply because I had
no way of knowing whether he was represented or not. I hadn't talked to
anybody who was really informed, and I called Mr. Wade. He said he didn't
know for sure whether he was or not, as far as he knew he hadn't been contacted
by any lawyer who purported to represent Oswald. I asked him whether
or not either he or anybody in his office had been advised that Oswald wanted a
lawyer, or had made a request for a lawyer, and he said as far as he knew he
had not asked for a lawyer. I asked him too, as he was going up there, and
I asked him if Oswald requested a lawyer and didn't have a lawyer would he
tell him that the Dallas Bar Association would get a lawyer if he needed one.</p>

<p>By that time I had time to think about what I thought my obligation should be,
and realizing that under the circumstances maybe some people might overlook
the fact that Oswald had rights that needed to be protected at the same time,
and if he didn't have a lawyer, regardless of what the legal obligation was to
appoint him a lawyer, we, the bar association, ought to look into the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade said he was going to go up there later on in the evening and he
would talk to his assistants who were in closer contact than he was, and if
Oswald wanted a lawyer&mdash;asked for a lawyer or wanted a lawyer appointed&mdash;he
would tell him of my conversation. I then called Glen King, and a captain
on the police force that I knew. I used to work for the city attorney's office, and
still represent the city credit union and have a brother on the police force,
so, I have known many of these people for many years. I called Captain King
and asked him whether or not Oswald was represented by an attorney, if he
knew if there was an attorney up there, or anybody who had been up there
representing him, and Captain King said that as far as he knew there had been
no one representing him, and as far as he knew, Oswald had not asked for a
lawyer. He had not asked for the right to call a lawyer, and&mdash;or had not
asked that a lawyer be furnished to him&mdash;and Captain King said, "If he does,
I am certainly going to call you and let you know, because we want to be sure
if he wants a lawyer he gets one. We don't want it to be a situation of anybody
saying that we deprived him of the right to have a lawyer."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, Glen, if you know at any time that he asks for a lawyer, or
wants a lawyer, or needs a lawyer, will you tell him that you have talked
to me, as president of the bar association, and that I have offered to get him
a lawyer if he wants one."</p>

<p>And Glen said, "Well, I'll just throw it back to you. You come down and
talk to him. I would be glad to have you talk to him."</p>

<p>I said, "I didn't know whether I wanted to or not at this point." I hadn't
quite decided at that point whether we could do something about it, and I
didn't know whether Oswald had his own attorney, but I told Captain King if I
decided to take him up on his offer I would come and see him.</p>

<p>It was about 3:30 or 4 o'clock. By that time I had talked to a criminal
lawyer, I had talked to Mr. Wade, I had talked to these two lawyer friends
of mine in trying to decide what, if anything I should do.</p>

<p>Up to that time I had not been told by any of these people that Oswald had
asked for a lawyer, or been denied a lawyer, or even knew whether he had a
lawyer. None of them knew for sure. I didn't&mdash;I then received a call from
another lawyer who was a professor out at S.M.U., and he wanted to know
whether or not the bar association was doing anything about getting a lawyer
for Oswald. I told him what had transpired, what I had done, and I hadn't
decided what should be done at this time, if anything by me, as president of the
bar association.</p>

<p>He seemed to think that it would be advisable and would be helpful if I
would go up and satisfy myself personally as to whether or not Oswald had
any lawyer, wanted a lawyer or was asking for a lawyer and hadn't been able
to get one, and I told him that I had not decided what to do, so, I sat around and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
decided if it had to be done. It seemed like enough time had gone by, and
enough uncertainty among the people I talked to as to whether or not he had a
lawyer or had asked for a lawyer that I decided I might as well go up and
talk to him, so, I cleaned up and went on up to the city hall. That was probably
5:30 or so in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. City hall is where he was confined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. City hall in Dallas, where Oswald was confined. Having worked
there I knew where the chief's office was.</p>

<p>I knew Captain King, the administrative assistant to the chief, and his
office was in the same place so, I went to the third floor of the city hall, now
called the Police and Courts Building.</p>

<p>The building in which the police department is located and the jail is
located, and where I assumed Oswald was at that time. I went up to the
third floor, and when I got off the elevator there was just a whole mob of reporters
and photographers and television cameras and cables and so forth
stretched out on that floor. Cables running in both directions, and I went down
into the chief's office, which is the eastern end of the building, and when I
went in there, there were a number of people in his office, in the reception
room, three or four people back in the chief's office, Chief Curry's office, a number
of people, and I asked one of the officers in the reception room if Captain
King was there and he said, "Well, he didn't think so."</p>

<p>About that time Chief Curry looked up and saw me, and he knew me and
motioned me in, and I went in there and he introduced me to one of the FBI
agents who was there, and I told him I was up there as president of the bar
association looking for Captain King. I had talked to him earlier and I had
come up there to see whether or not Mr. Oswald had a lawyer, or needed a lawyer,
or wanted the Dallas Bar Association to do anything.</p>

<p>The chief said that he was glad to see me and would take me up to see
Oswald himself and, so, we immediately left his office and started to another
part of the building, and he asked me where I wanted to talk to him. If I
wanted to be taken to a room or some place, or what would be convenient with
me, and I told him that any place would be all&mdash;I just wanted to visit with
the man and see what his situation was with regard to him having a lawyer.
So, we then went through a door on the third floor and got into the elevator
and went up to the sixth floor, and the chief again asked me where I wanted
to talk to him. I said, "Well, just any place."</p>

<p>By that time we had gotten to a portion of the jail that was separated by bars
and a door. Beyond that door were three separate cells, and there was an
officer seated outside one, and then we went through the first door and got
to that point and Mr. Oswald was in the center of the three cells, no one being
in the other two, and there was an officer seated outside there. The chief
had the officer open the door, and he introduced me to Oswald, and told him
my name and said that I was the president of the Dallas Bar Association and
had come up to see him about whether or not he needed or wanted a lawyer,
and then the chief stepped back and&mdash;I don't really know how far away. He
was at least&mdash;he was far enough removed where I couldn't observe him or see
him there in the cell. The officer stayed just right outside the door there. I
reintroduced myself to Oswald and told him my name, and that I was president
of the Dallas bar, and that I had come up to see him about whether or not
he had a lawyer, or needed a lawyer, or wanted a lawyer, and suggested that
he sit down.</p>

<p>So, he sat on one bunk and I sat on the other. Maybe 3 or 4 feet apart.
When I got there he was lying on a bunk, and then he stood up when I came
in and then he sat on one bunk and I sat on the other, much as you and I are
seated here, only actually, a little bit closer, and I asked him if he had a
lawyer, and he said, "Well, he really didn't know what it was all about, that
he was&mdash;had been incarcerated, and kept incommunicado," and I said, "Well,
I have come up to see whether or not you want a lawyer, because as I understand&mdash;"
I am not exactly sure what I said there, or whether he said something
about not knowing what happened to President Kennedy, or I said that I
understood that he was arrested for the shot that killed the President, and I don't
remember who said what after that. This is a little bit vague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
I had covered that point in detail, and I don't recall exactly, but in any
event, our conversation was such that I informed him that I was there to see
whether or not he had a lawyer, or wanted a lawyer, and he said&mdash;he asked me
first did I know a lawyer in New York named John Abt, and I don't know if it is
A-b-t, or A-p-t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I believe it is A-b-t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I believe it is. In New York City, I said I didn't know him, and
he said, "Well, I would like to have him to represent me," and at some period I
believe prior to that, either in talking to the police, or talking to&mdash;must have
been talking to either Captain King or the chief&mdash;I had been told that some
effort had been made to get hold of Mr. Abt, and that he was in Connecticut at his
home, and maybe, and I have forgotten who said who was trying to get ahold
of him. At least, I did vaguely know that someone was trying to get ahold
of him, but I told Mr. Oswald I didn't know him. He said, "Well, that is the
man he would like to have represent him." Then he asked me if I knew any
lawyers who were members of the American Civil Liberties Union, and he
said, "Well, I am a member of that organization, and I would like to have somebody
who is a member of that organization represent me." And I said, "I'm
sorry, I don't know anybody who is a member of that organization."</p>

<p>Although, as it turned out later, a number of lawyers I know are members.
Two or three of them called me later. He said, "Well, if I can't get either one
of those, and if I can&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That is <span class="locked">either&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. "Either Mr. Abt or someone who is a member of the American
Civil Liberties Union, and if I can find a lawyer here who believes in anything
I believe in, and believes as I believe, and believes in my innocence"&mdash;then
paused a little bit, and went on a little bit and said, "as much as he can, I
might let him represent me."</p>

<p>I said, "What I am interested in knowing is right now, do you want me
or the Dallas Bar Association to try to get you a lawyer?"</p>

<p>He said, "No, not now."</p>

<p>He said, "You might come back next week, and if I don't get some of these
other people to represent me, I might ask you to get somebody to represent
me."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, now, all I want to do is to make it clear to you, and to me,
whether or not you want me or the Dallas Bar Association to do anything about
getting a lawyer right now."</p>

<p>And he said "No."</p>

<p>I was satisfied in my own mind that he knew what he was doing, and that
he didn't want me or the Dallas Bar Association to do anything right now.
So, I left, and as I left the chief asked me whether or not I wanted to make a
statement to the press, and I said, "Well, I don't know whether I do or not.
I don't know whether it is the thing to do or not." And he said, "Well, they
are going to be right outside the door there, and if you want to say anything
this would be an opportunity to do it."</p>

<p>He said, "Incidentally, I am very glad you came up here. We don't want any
question coming up about us refusing to let him have a lawyer. As far as I
know, he has never asked for one. He has never asked to call one."</p>

<p>And I believe the chief mentioned that Mr. Abt's name, but he said, "He
has never asked us to call him."</p>

<p>He said, "Do you think we have an obligation?" And I said, "I don't know."</p>

<p>He said, "I am glad that you came down and talked to him. At least that
takes a problem off of us about not furnishing him a lawyer."</p>

<p>And so, we&mdash;about that time we stepped out of the door and there was just a
whole swarm of photographers and cameramen standing right there. Right
outside the door on the third floor. They came out in the third floor, reached
back down in the third floor, and the chief told them who I was, and what I
had been up there for, and oh, for 4 or 5 minutes, what turned out to be live
television interview, whether or not&mdash;they asked me if I thought he was guilty,
and if he had admitted anything, and I told them that I didn't ask him, and he
didn't tell me, and they merely wanted to know the reason I was up here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
that interview is something, I assume, that you have, or will be made available.
I don't remember exactly what transpired, and then&mdash;but they asked me what
his attitude was, whether he was belligerent and&mdash;or scared, and to me, he
appeared to be neither belligerent nor scared. He appeared to be a man that
was pretty calm, I thought, under the circumstances. He appeared to me
that he knew where he was and pretty much what his rights were with regard
to being represented, and he knew apparently&mdash;at least the conversation was
that if he didn't get somebody to represent him that he wanted that he could
always fall back on the bar association, or somebody, and I had told him that
I would see him next week if he wanted me to, and I satisfied myself at least,
to the extent, that the man appeared to know what he was doing. He did not
appear to be irrational. He appeared to be calm. He turned down my offer of
help, and I felt like at that point that was all I needed to do, and this was later
Saturday afternoon, and I had no inkling that anything else, except maybe that
the next week if he didn't get a lawyer I might hear from him, or check into
it, and that's all I know about Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That's quite a complete statement. Let's just cover a few details.
What was his physical condition, as you observed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he had a little scratch, or bruise over one eye. I have
forgotten whether over the left or right, but other than that, as I recall, there
were no indication of any other injuries or marks on him that I could tell. He
was dressed, I believe, in a white T-shirt and slacks, and appeared to me to be
in normal condition. I mean, there was nothing obviously wrong with him
from a physical standpoint, as I could observe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he seem well rested, or tired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he seemed all right. When I went in there he was lying
on his back and he got up and he didn't&mdash;he looked like he was calm, and was
rested, and it&mdash;didn't appear to have&mdash;now this is a guess, and my own observation,
did not appear to me to have been mistreated. I was interested in observing
whether or not he&mdash;it looked like he had been mistreated, because, as a
lawyer, I anticipate perhaps that he&mdash;if he had been mistreated, or might claim
he had been mistreated it was something I should have observed at that time, and
I observed nothing to indicate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. He, I gather, used the word "incommunicado" to <span class="locked">describe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; that was his word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he elaborate on that, or any&mdash;or indicate to you that he
had not been able to see members of his family or other people of his choice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he did not say that he had been refused anything. Just
didn't elaborate, and I really didn't ask him at that point. My inquiry was
intentionally very limited. I merely wanted to know whether he had a lawyer,
if he had a lawyer then I had no problems.</p>

<p>If he asked for a lawyer and they did not offer him one, that was contrary
to what I had been told, because I had been told, as far as the police were concerned,
and Mr. Wade, as he recalled, that the man had never asked for a lawyer.
Nor had he asked to call a lawyer, for the right to call a lawyer, so that I was
interested in knowing whether or not he had a lawyer and whether or not he
had requested a lawyer and been refused, because the story up east was that he
couldn't get a lawyer to represent him, and I knew that that wasn't true, because
I know Dallas lawyers, and I know that if the man had to have a lawyer, we
could have gotten one for him. So, I didn't go into the other questions, or
whether or not he wanted to see his family and hadn't been permitted. I really
was concerned about whether or not he had a lawyer or wanted a lawyer, or
whether we had any obligations to furnish him one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes; I see. Did he elaborate on his statement to you that he
preferred a lawyer who believed in what he believed in, or was this <span class="locked">as&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not at all. He said&mdash;I didn't ask him, because I didn't know
any lawyers&mdash;and I didn't know what he believed in, and I really wasn't concerned
at that stage in the man's beliefs or what he had done or not done,
actually, I just wanted&mdash;the man was in jail, and it occurred to me that it would
be easy to overlook his rights at that time in view of the great emotion and
somebody ought to determine whether or not he wanted a lawyer, and I decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
as president of the bar association maybe that was my job to do it, so, I went
up there to see about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You say he said he wanted a lawyer who believed in his innocence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. As much as he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As he could?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he elaborate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; and I didn't ask him to elaborate on it because at that
stage I didn't know to what extent I would, or wanted to, or should become
embroiled in the facts. I wanted to know whether he needed a lawyer, and I
didn't anticipate that I would be his lawyer, because I don't practice criminal
law. They asked me, the newspapers did, and I honestly don't know what my
answer would have been if they had asked me, "Well, will you represent him?"</p>

<p>We can debate about that now until doomsday. All I know is when I went
up to talk to him I did not anticipate being the lawyer, because I don't practice
criminal law, although, when I talked to Henry Wade he said, jokingly, I hope
it was jokingly, and if the guy wants a lawyer he was going to request the judge
that he appoint me and the president of the criminal bar association to represent
him. I took that to be not a serious suggestion, because he knows that I don't
practice criminal law, although, on reflection that probably would have been a
good recommendation, since generally, I suppose, that if they appointed the
president of the bar association they couldn't say that he was getting inferior
representation. I am not bragging about that, but normally, I think that
would be the normal reaction that if they appointed the president of the criminal
bar association and the president of the local bar association then at least
the man would be represented.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What is the practice in this jurisdiction regarding the appointment
of counsel for indigents accused in criminal cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Basically, I think that would follow the statutes which provide
that where it comes to the attention of the court, that a man charged with
a felony is not represented by an attorney that the court will appoint an
attorney to represent him. The statute further provides that the attorney
appointed to represent indigents be paid $25 a day for each day actually present
at the trial of the case in court, and not to exceed $100 for the handling of an
appeal. The usual procedure is, I believe, when it comes to the attention
of the judge that an accused in jail is not represented by an attorney&mdash;I am
talking about a felony case now&mdash;or a man, whether he is in jail or not, if he
makes requests of the court to appoint him a lawyer, the judges of the criminal
district court will, and do appoint lawyers to represent those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But, ordinarily, the appointment is handled by the judiciary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And there is no, I take it, organized system of the bar association
to represent indigents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, the criminal&mdash;there are two bar associations in Dallas.
One is the criminal bar association, the other is the Dallas Bar Association,
and you may belong to both, or neither, or either one. The criminal bar
association did, last year, attempt to create and establish a fund to defray
some investigative expenses of lawyers appointed to represent indigents. One
of the programs which I had hoped to get really underway last year when
I was president was to, and we had a committee working on it, was to provide
more lawyers who would be willing to accept appointments to represent indigent
defendants in the criminal cases. My idea was that if we had 100 or 200 lawyers
who would say, "If I am requested to, or appointed by the court, I will represent
these people." And it was my desire to have a large number of lawyers who
would do that. The committee, unfortunately, bogged down and I got involved
in other matters that I guess I considered more urgent to me, and didn't pursue
that, but I did go down and talk to one of the judges last year just to see what
the procedure was because I was interested, and the judges do appoint these
people, I mean, do appoint attorneys to represent these people, and I talked
to one of the judges and he said that they have never yet had an occasion where
he needed a lawyer to represent a defendant that they haven't been able to
get one. So, although some of these lawyers may do this more than others, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
far as I know, none of them have refused because it was too much of an imposition
on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Your activities with respect to Oswald were unusual, though,
and not pursuant to any established arrangement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Something you did because of the nature of the case, and the
questions that had been raised, and your own questions about his treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you, Mr. Nichols, make any notes of your activities on November
23, 1963, either at the time, or did you at any later time have occasion to
prepare a written report of your activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I did not make any notes at the time, and I didn't make any
notes as such, subsequently, after Mr. Oswald was killed. And why, I don't
know. It didn't occur to me to do so. Later Mr. Leon Jaworski, a Houston,
Tex., attorney, called me and said that he was going to go to Miami, Fla., to
the meeting of American Trial Lawyers, and had been asked to make a report
of some sort on the Oswald matter and he asked me if I would write him a letter
outlining what I had done in connection with interviewing Oswald, and attempting
to see whether or not he wanted the Dallas Bar Association to provide
counsel. I did, at that time, write a letter to Mr. Jaworski outlining as I
recalled at that time exactly what transpired. Later the president of the
Houston Bar Association, George Barrow, called me and said he was going
to make a little talk in Houston, or write a little article in a publication and
would like to know what I had done, and he knew about the letter I had sent
to Jaworski, and wanted to know if I would send him a copy of my letter to
him, or outline what I had done. I said it would be easier to give him a copy of
the letter I had written to Leon, because I have it, so I sent him a copy and
those are the only notes I made or statements that I have made in writing
regarding this transaction except I did reproduce a copy of the letter to Mr.
Jaworski, which I furnished to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I show you now a copy of the letter dated February 10, 1964,
to Mr. Jaworski. Is that the copy you furnished to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That is the copy I furnished to you, and the copy of the letter
which I wrote to Mr. Jaworski on that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you initial each of the four pages of that photostatic copy,
please, which we'll attach to your deposition as Exhibit A.</p>

<p>Thank you, sir. I believe that completes all the questions I have, Mr. Nichols.
Thank you very much for coming in today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. You certainly are welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The court reporter will transcribe the deposition and we can
furnish a copy of it to you for your review and signature, or the reporter
can send the transcript directly to the Commission without your review, if
you care to <span class="locked">waive&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I would like to have a copy of it, if I may do so, and I understand
that it will be available at some expense, whatever it costs&mdash;I want to
furnish it to the bar association for their records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine.</p>

<h2 id="t332">TESTIMONY OF FORREST V. SORRELS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Forrest V. Sorrels was taken at 9:45 a.m., on May 7, 1964, at
200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C. by Mr. Samuel A. Stern, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission. Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel
for the President's Commission, and Mr. Fred B. Smith, Deputy General Counsel,
U.S. Treasury Department were present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Good morning, Mr. Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Good morning, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You understand that this is a continuation of your deposition,
and that you are still under oath?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yesterday you covered with Mr. Hubert the events that transpired
from the time of the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald <span class="locked">forward.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>

<div class="p2 footnote narrow">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> That portion of the deposition of Forrest V. Sorrels appears in another volume, and
can be found by consulting the Index.</p></div>

<p>I would like to go back now with you and cover the advance preparations
for the President's trip, and come up to the time of the shooting of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you tell us first something of your experience in Presidential
protection work through the course of your career in the Secret
Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; the first real assignment that I had in connection with
Presidential work was in 1936, at Dallas, Tex., when President Roosevelt came
there, and there was a parade downtown, motorcade out to the Cotton Bowl
at Fair Park, where he made a talk, and then from there to the Adolphus Hotel
for luncheon, and from the Adolphus Hotel to Lee Park, where he unveiled
a monument, and then motored to Fort Worth, Tex., where there was a reception
committee that met him on the lawn at the Texas Pacific Railroad Station,
and then motored to a park in Fort Worth where he made a talk, and then
continued on out to his son Elliott's ranch, west of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>During the time that President Roosevelt was in office, there were a number
of times that he came to Fort Worth to visit his son.</p>

<p>One in particular that I recall was during the Second World War, when it
was necessary that his travels be kept secret, and we were able to get him
into his son's home and visit the airplane factory where the B-36 was manufactured
there at Fort Worth, and get him out of town, and it was some 2
hours after that before any reporter ever found out and called our office
inquiring about the President.</p>

<p>I have been to Washington on inaugurations two times that I can recall, the
last one being at the time that President Kennedy was inaugurated.</p>

<p>I have been assigned on surveys in connection with inaugurations. I have
been in Mexico on three different occasions when the President visited there,
to Mexico City, Monterey, the last one being at Falcon Dam, when the dam
was dedicated by the two Presidents of Mexico and the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That was President Eisenhower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Have you worked on visits by President Kennedy to Texas before
this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; there were two visits that he made there&mdash;one a very
short notice one of a matter of a few hours, when he came to Dallas to visit Mr.
Rayburn in Baylor Hospital. Then when he came to Bonham, at the time Mr.
Rayburn was buried&mdash;we had the assignments in connection with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. These were informal trips, without publicity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. There was publicity. For example, the one that he came to the
hospital, it wasn't announced until about 10 o'clock in the morning that he
would be there.</p>

<p>He came there, I guess, a little over 2 or 3 hours after that&mdash;just a very quick
trip, and not much time to make any preparation.</p>

<p>But, fortunately, everything went real good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Sorrels, is there any significant difference that occurs to you
in the protective arrangements, including the advance arrangements, for the
November trip to Dallas by President Kennedy, and this trip you were telling
us about that President Roosevelt made to Dallas, which involved a similar
motorcade, in 1936, I believe you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. About the same advance preparation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Protective organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Of course in the one that President Roosevelt came there, it was more functions
and more places to go, including two cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes. <span class="locked">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. But the actual preparation was along the same lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You have been following a procedure and pattern as long as you
have been doing this kind of work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It has been pretty much the same procedure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you know that a President is coming to the area under your
jurisdiction, what arrangements do you try to work out with the Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We will have a conference with the Chief of Police and his key
personnel, usually when it is determined what the program is going to be.</p>

<p>In some instances where there has to be a meeting with the advance man from
the White House detail, and for the local committee and the plans are not
entirely solid, we have found that to bring the police in at that time is a little bit
premature, because I have known of instances where we have had such meetings
and the orders have been cut, and then they had to be changed, because of some
change.</p>

<p>So, insofar as is possible, the meeting with the police is held at a time when
we know pretty much what the program is going to be. And that procedure is
followed in every instance.</p>

<p>In some instances, as I mentioned a moment ago there, when President
Kennedy came to the Baylor Hospital, we didn't have very much time&mdash;it is
something we have to work out very rapidly, and which was done in this instance
with the Chief of Police and his key men, and the security was set up on
a very, very short notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But normally, when you have the time, you like, as I understand
it, to try to make your <span class="locked">arrangements&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes; as far in advance as possible, because we realize that it
is quite a task for them, because they have got many men involved, and many
things that have to be taken into consideration, so that their orders can be
properly drawn and the men dispatched to the proper places with a knowledge
of what they are supposed to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But you do try to have the trip or the motorcade route, if there
is to be a motorcade, pretty well worked out before you go to the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We usually have an idea what we would like to do, and we, of
course, confer with the police because they may have in instances knowledge
that we don't have about a certain area that it might not be appropriate to use
or to go into.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Let's see if we can relate this now to President Kennedy's trip to
Dallas in November.</p>

<p>When did you first hear that he was to make this trip, Mr. Sorrels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. On November 4, 1963, I received a long distance call from Special
Agent in Charge Gerald A. Behn, of the White House Detail, stating that the
President would probably visit Dallas about November 21, and that there had
been a couple of buildings suggested, one of them being the Trade Mart, which
he understood had about 60 entrances to it, and six catwalks over the area where
the luncheon would be. And that the second choice that had been suggested
then was the Women's Building at the State Fair Grounds. That was another
place referred to as a trade center, which is actually Market Hall, which is
across the street from the Trade Mart.</p>

<p>He instructed that I make a survey of these buildings and report back to him
the conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Accompanied by Special Agent Robert A. Stewart of my office,
we went to the Trade Mart and looked the situation over there, and we did find
that there were entrances coming into, you might call it, a courtyard where the
luncheon was to have been&mdash;entrances coming into that area. And that there
were two suspension bridges or catwalks on the second floor and on the third
floor.</p>

<p>The outside entrances were no particular problem, but it did mean that it
would take quite a bit of manpower to cover each one of the entrances that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
could come on to the balcony, you might say, that was entirely around on the
second and the third floors.</p>

<p>We then went to the Market Hall, which was ideal insofar as security measures
were concerned, in that there were only three outside entrances, and it was a
huge hall, 107,000 square feet, with no columns, and you could seat about 20,000
people in there.</p>

<p>But there was another function going to be there at that time&mdash;the American
Bottling Association was going to have, as I recall, an exhibit there. So that
part was out.</p>

<p>We then went to Fair Park, where we made a survey of the Women's Building.
It is a place where they have exhibits during the fair of all kinds of handiwork
and things like that.</p>

<p>That building had about 45,000 square feet in it, and you could seat about
5,000 people in it. Securitywise it wasn't bad at all, because there were two
end openings to the building, and there was actually an area where you could
drive a car in there. But the building was not satisfactory for that type of
function&mdash;the President of the United States coming there&mdash;because the ceilings
were quite low, the air-conditioning equipment and everything was all exposed,
there were many steel suspension supports throughout the area.</p>

<p>I then returned to my office and telephoned to Mr. Behn and informed him
of my findings and told him that securitywise the Women's Building appeared
to be preferable, but that it wasn't a very nice place to take the President.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did you tell him about the Trade Mart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I told him that there were many entrances there and that it
would pose a problem manpowerwise to have the proper security there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But did you indicate to him that this could be handled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don't recall whether I specifically said it could be or not.
Definitely I was under the impression that if the place was chosen, we would
take the necessary precautions and would have it properly manned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You did not, in any event, tell him that you didn't think the
Trade Mart would be a safe place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I don't recall I told him it would not be a safe place, no,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When did all this happen, Mr. Sorrels? Was it immediately after
November 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, it was on November 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was the next event in your advance preparations for the
President's trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. On November 13, Special Agent Winston G. Lawson, from the
White House detail, and Mr. Jack Puterbaugh, had arrived at Dallas the evening
before, and they came to my office, and we then went to the office of Mr. A.
W. Cullum, President of the Chamber of Commerce, and we then went to the
Trade Mart, and then to the Women's Building at the State Fairgrounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Sorrels, would you look at this Xerox copy of a two-page
memorandum which appears to be signed by you, dated November 30, 1963,
and carries the identifying number CO-2-34030. Can you identify that for me,
please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; that is a memorandum which was prepared by me on
November 30, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you make this memorandum in the ordinary course of your
work, or were you specially instructed to make it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, I was instructed to make the report, but it is a
procedure we ordinarily follow in making memorandums of such surveys, in
confirmation of the phone calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you make it from notes that you had or from memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Both, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you preserve the notes from which this was made, or destroy
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I preserved them. I have them here&mdash;regarding the phone
call and the notes that I made, regarding the survey at the Trade Mart and
Women's Club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. May I see them, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And this covers what you have just been telling us about in
connection with the selection of the luncheon site for the President's visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Have you reviewed your memorandum of November 30 recently,
Mr. Sorrels, in preparation for your testimony here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is there any respect in which you would like to change anything
that is in the memorandum in view of your further consideration of the events
described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. There is only one point there, about the date that we went
by the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Where is that covered in your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is in the last paragraph on the first page, where it is
stated that on November 15, that we went to the office of the Chief of Police
Curry.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that it was possibly the day before. I could be in
error on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In any event, it was after Mr. Lawson had arrived, and that was
on November 13?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. I might state here that I had previously received two
phone calls from Chief of Police Jesse Curry about the President's trip there.
He was, of course, wanting to get the information as soon as possible, so that
they could start their preparations. And he actually called me before Mr.
Lawson got there, and he called me again after Mr. Lawson had gotten there,
before we had gone to see him. And I explained to the chief that, on the
first call, there would be someone from the White House detail coming to Dallas,
and he requested that I get in touch with him just as soon as he got there.</p>

<p>On the second call, I told him that the man from the White House detail
had arrived, but that we were still working on the plans, that it was not
definitely known at that time where the luncheon was going to be, and that
just as soon as it was determined where the luncheon was going to be, that we
would then get in touch with him.</p>

<p>And it was at my suggestion to Mr. Lawson that we go by the Police Department
on the first time, because I did not want the chief to feel that we were
leaving him out in the dark, so to speak. And, for that reason, I suggested
that we go by at the time we did&mdash;because, actually, we were still in the process
of having these meetings to work out the final plans, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That is the visit you refer to in this last paragraph on page 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Your memorandum, Mr. Sorrels, gives me enough information on
many of the points we are interested in, and I don't think we have to cover
those, unless you would like to add something to them.</p>

<p>I would like to have you tell us about the selection of the motorcade route,
what you had to do with that, and what you know of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. After it was determined that there was going to be a motorcade,
which was actually after Mr. Lawson got there, we had discussed the ways to
get to the Trade Mart, and one of my questions was why don't we bring the
President from the Texas Hotel to the Trade Mart by motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Texas <span class="locked">Hotel&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. In Fort Worth&mdash;because I knew we would be able to pick the
President up at the Texas Hotel in Fort Worth, and by motor get him to the
Trade Mart in a shorter time than it would take him to go from the Texas Hotel
to the Air Force Base, and go by plane to Love Field, and from Love Field go
to the Trade Mart.</p>

<p>But that was ruled out because the previous plans were that he was to come
by plane. And, of course, it would not have been practical to have brought him
by motor from Fort Worth if there was going to be a downtown parade, because
it would have meant coming in from the west side of the city, and we would
have to go right back to the west side of the city to get to the Trade Mart, which
would have meant a complete loop through the downtown section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
So when it was determined that there was going to be a downtown parade,
Mr. Lawson, of course, wanted to know which would be the best route to take
him to the Trade Mart from Love Field.</p>

<p>So Mr. Lawson and I drove what I thought would be the best route and the
most direct route to the Trade Mart, bearing in mind that there would be a
parade through the downtown section.</p>

<p>So we drove that route. And then later on we had the police go with us, and
we went over the same route.</p>

<p>There were some discussions as to one section, whether it would be better
to get onto what we have known as the Central Expressway there, and come
off of it into Main Street. But that was ruled out because of safety measures,
going into the expressway, and it would only be for such a short distance.</p>

<p>Another thing, too, they wanted as many people as possible to see him, that
would not have any opportunity to see him on the Central Expressway.</p>

<p>So the route that we chose was from Love Field approach to Mockingbird
Lane, left on Mockingbird Lane to Lemmon, down Lemmon to Turtle, right on
Turtle Creek to Cedar Springs, left on Cedar Springs to Harwood, right from
Harwood on Main Street, continue down Main Street to Houston Street, and
then make a right-hand turn to Elm Street and then under the underpass to
Stemmons Expressway, which was the most direct route from there and the
most rapid route to the Trade Mart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Excuse me&mdash;you said right-hand turn to Elm. I think you mean
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. A right-hand turn on Houston&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;and a left-hand
turn on Elm.</p>

<p>Now, Elm is one way going west in the direction which we would have gone,
but that street is not the street that they use for parades.</p>

<p>Main Street is right through the heart of the city. It is the best choice for
parades. It gives an opportunity for more people&mdash;tall buildings on the side of
the street&mdash;and it is almost invariably&mdash;every parade that is had is on Main
Street. The one in 1936, when President Roosevelt was there, was the same
route in reverse, so to speak.</p>

<p>We came up on Houston Street from Union Station, turned right on Main
Street, right on Main Street, through the very heart of the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And went right past the School Book Depository then on Houston
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Just within 1 block of it, because we were coming, in that instance,
from the Union Station, which is south of the Depository, to Main
Street, right on Main Street, which is just 1 block from the Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I take it, then, that once you were told there was to be a motorcade,
and approximately 45 minutes was allotted to the motorcade, this route
pretty well mapped itself, apart from the question whether to use the expressway
or Harwood Street to get on to Main Street, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Why didn't you route the motorcade on Main Street under the
triple overpass and on to Stemmons Freeway that way, instead of going to
Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Well, because you cannot get to the entrance to Stemmons Expressway
on Main Street. The traffic is not routed that way. It is impractical.</p>

<p>On the other side of the first underpass there is a section built up to prevent
cars from cutting in from Main Street to get over to Elm Street there. And
if a person would go from&mdash;try to go from Main Street over to Stemmons Expressway,
they would have to either hurdle this built-up place there, island,
you might call it, or an extension of an <span class="locked">island&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you know what this built-up place is constructed of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It is, I am sure, asphalt, or concrete&mdash;probably concrete. You
would have to go down on Main Street, pass where you would ordinarily turn
off, and then come back against traffic, which would be one way that way, and
make a hairpin turn, and come back and get on there. It just is not done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Could that reverse-S turn which you have described have been
done conveniently with a car the size of the Presidential limousine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, it would not be convenient with an ordinary car, because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
would be a very sharp hairpin turn, and the place that is built there is there
specifically to prevent anyone from getting over on the wrong way there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you laid out the motorcade route and drove over it&mdash;and
I take it you drove over it several <span class="locked">times&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you consider or discuss with Mr. Lawson the possibility of
any danger to the President from the buildings along the route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you think about any of the buildings as presenting any particular
problem?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. All buildings are a problem, as far as we are concerned. That,
insofar as I have been concerned&mdash;and I am sure that every member of the
Service, especially the Detail&mdash;that is always of concern to us. We always consider
it a hazard. During the time that we were making this survey with the
police, I made the remark that if someone wanted to get the President of the
United States, he could do it with a high-powered rifle and a telescopic sight from
some building or some hillside, because that has always been a concern to us,
about the buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall any further conversation, any further remarks in
that conversation? Did anybody respond to that remark? Only if you recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don't recall any particular response. Probably there was
confirmation of that fact, because I think that anyone that has had any experience
in security measures would have the same opinion. I don't recall anyone
specifically making any comment like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But there was no suggestion that anything might be done to minimize
that risk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Nothing more than what we always do&mdash;try to scan the windows,
and if we see something suspicious, take proper action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you went over the parade route with the police officials, did
they confirm your view that this was the proper route to use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And there was no concern expressed by them that some other route
might be better for some reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I would like you now, Mr. Sorrels, to tell us something of the
Protective Research activities that took place in preparation for the President's
visit to Dallas, that you recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. At that time, we had no known Protective Research subjects that
we were making periodic checks on in that area. Mr. Lawson informed me
that he had checked with PRS, and that was confirmed.</p>

<p>However, bearing in mind the incidents that had taken place some time before
with Mr. Stevenson, I had instructed Special Agent John Joe Howlett, to work
with the Special Services Bureau of the Police Department, and I also conferred
by phone with the chief of police at Denton, Tex., because some of those individuals
who were involved in the Stevenson affair were going to college there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was the Stevenson affair, as far as you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That was an instance where a number of people were at a theatre,
as I recall it, theatre building, when Mr. Stevenson came out, and they were
there with placards, and one woman is alleged to have hit him over the head
with a placard, and another individual spat upon Mr. Stevenson, and also a police
officer that took him into custody. And I did not want any such instance to
happen when the President of the United States was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How soon had that happened before the President's visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don't remember. It was probably some 60 days, maybe, before.</p>

<p>It was quite some time before.</p>

<p>But within recent time. And so Mr. Anderson, chief of police, informed me
that he had an informant that was keeping in touch with the situation. I arranged
with the Dallas Police Department for Lieutenant Revill to accompany
Special Agent Howlett to Denton, and confer with the police there, and to also
get photographs of these individuals.</p>

<p>When we were conferring with Mr. Felix McKnight, the managing editor of the
Dallas Times Herald, I learned that&mdash;from him&mdash;that they had photographs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
taken at the Stevenson incident. So arrangements were made whereby Special
Agent Howlett and the members of the Dallas Police Department, together with
the informant in the case, would view those films, so that there could be pointed
out to them individuals known to have been in the incident.</p>

<p>We had duplicate pictures made, and they were furnished to the special agent
assigned to the Trade Mart, and were shown to the police officers that were
assigned out in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did anything else occur in the field of Protective Research?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is all I can recall at the present time.</p>

<p>Now, we had received, I think, some time before, a report from the FBI of an
individual that might be considered a subject that we should check into. On
October 30, Special Agent Vince Drain of the FBI reported a person, a member
supposedly of the Ku Klux Klan in Denison, Tex., who might be suspected as a
person that might try to cause some trouble if and when the President came to
that area.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Revill got a photograph of that individual and he was checked on,
and it was determined that he would not be in that area at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did the FBI report anything else to your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. On the morning of November 21, as I recall it, Special Agent
Hosty came to the office early in the morning with a number of handbills which
bore a picture of the President of the United States, Mr. Kennedy, with the
caption, "Wanted for Treason," with a number of numbered paragraphs supposedly
outlining the reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did your office make an investigation of that pamphlet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I had previously received the information early in the morning
from the sheriff's office that such handbills had been found on the streets. We
contacted the police department, Lieutenant Revill, and they had a number of the
handbills, and they were just found on the street. We could not from the police
investigation or from our inquiries, find anyone that had seen anyone actually
distributing them.</p>

<p>And we had no other leads on the handbills at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did the Dallas police give you any information of this nature&mdash;I
am not referring specifically to the handbills, but to the Protective Research
area, in advance of the President's trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Nothing more than what I believe I have outlined with Lieutenant
Revill's department there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was there anything else that you recall involving any person or
group that might present a danger to the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. There was some individuals from Grand Prairie, Tex., that were
mentioned to us by the police department that were known to be the type that
might appear with handbills or placards&mdash;not handbills, but with placards in
the area where the President might appear. And it developed that they did
show up with placards at the Trade Mart, and they were taken into custody
by the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did your office also take steps to assure that there would be no
interference with free speech and lawful public demonstrations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, we discussed with the police what action would be taken
if people showed up with placards and attempted to interfere. And it was very
definitely stated that if they had placards, just the mere fact that they had
placards would not cause them to be picked up. But that we did not want them
close enough to where the President would come or where he would be that
these might be used to cause any harm to the President or the Vice President or
members of their families.</p>

<p>There had recently been passed in Dallas an ordinance making it unlawful
for any person to interfere or attempt to interfere with or intimidate another
from freely entering premises where a private or public assembly was being held.
We obtained copies of that ordinance and studied them to see what action the
police would be able to take in the event that any instance arose whereby this
ordinance might need to be enforced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, you have told us, Mr. Sorrels, that you had no record of any
PRS subject that you were checking on in your office, and that Lawson advised
you that he had been told of no subject in your area in his advance check before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
he left Washington. Did this surprise you, that there were no individuals
who had previously been identified as potential threats to the President in the
territory of the Dallas office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No. We had records of some subjects that were in institutions,
but they were not out where they would be available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Had there been in the past, during your tenure in the Dallas
office, PRS subjects who were not in institutions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But there were none at this particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When the incident involving Ambassador Stevenson had occurred,
did you consider obtaining information on the participants and referring
that information to the Protective Research Section in Washington for their
files?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not unless the President or the Vice President would come to
that area, I had no intention doing that, because there was no actual threat,
nor was the President of the United States involved in name or otherwise, insofar
as I knew, in connection with the Stevenson affair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How has the cooperation been with local authorities and local
officers of Federal agencies in advising you of any potential danger to the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We have received reports of phone calls and threats or something
like that from time to time. I think that all of the Federal offices that come
into any information about a threat concerning the President of the United
States have certainly in the past, to my recollection&mdash;I don't recall any specific
instance&mdash;but I do know we have received such reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And from the local police authorities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I can't recall any specific instance, but I am sure that in the
past there have been instances where such a report has been reported to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Have you made known to the local authorities the kind of information
in which you would be interested in this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. We have participated in the training schools of the Dallas
Police Department, and the Fort Worth Police Department, the auxiliary
schools conducted by the sheriff's office and the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>We have participated in schools at Austin, Tex., given by the Department of
Public Safety to investigative officers, to sheriffs-elect, deputy sheriffs and other
sheriffs.</p>

<p>We have participated at Texas A &amp; M College, at College Station, Tex., in
their program of police training, where they have students that are members of
various police departments, and other law enforcement organizations that
attend their classes.</p>

<p>And in our course of instruction, we have discussed with them the protective
measures that are required and taken in connection with the protection of the
President of the United States, members of his family, and the Vice President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How is your liaison with the local police and local offices of
Federal agencies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I consider it very, very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In all respects?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. In all respects; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Had you requested any local Federal agency, for example FBI or
Internal Revenue, to participate in any way in the actual protection measures
for the day of the President's visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I had offers from some of the other agencies, offering their
services in case there was anything they could assist in.</p>

<p>The usual reply to that is that we are working with the local officials, police
department, sheriff's department, Department of Public Safety, and we feel
that we have sufficient manpower to take care of the program as we have in
the past, and we have always suggested, in not only this instance but in other
instances, that if any member of their department should hear of anything,
or see anything unusual, that they felt we should know about, to please get in
touch with us immediately, along those lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You felt, then, that the local police forces would supply all the
outside assistance you needed for this visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; the Dallas Police Department, in my opinion, has some
very good leaders, career men who have been there for many years, and due
to the fact I have been located in Dallas for many, many years I know these
people personally, and I have never yet called upon the Dallas Police Department,
the Sheriff's Office, or the Department of Public Safety, for any assistance
that we have not gotten and gotten cheerfully and willingly.</p>

<p>For example, the time that Mr. Kennedy came there to the hospital to see
Mr. Rayburn, is a case where I could tell nobody until just a matter of 2 or 3
hours before the President would get there, that he was coming, because the
afternoon before, when I heard that he was coming, it was supposed to have
been off the record, and there was not supposed to be any publicity about it.</p>

<p>The next morning I got a call and said it would be announced at 10 o'clock
in the morning.</p>

<p>Well, immediately after that I called Chief Curry and he met me at the
hospital with some of his key men, and the arrangements were set up in a
matter of minutes, you might say, arrangements for the street to be blocked
by the hospital, for sufficient detectives and men to be around the area, in
various places in the hospital, and arrangements were made to have the police
cars to accompany us from the airport down there.</p>

<p>I consider that our relationship with the local enforcement agencies, not
only in the Dallas area, but throughout Texas, is as good as it can be any place
in the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. On the occasion of President Kennedy's visit, they supplied all
the manpower you felt was necessary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were all the police that had various functions along the motorcade
route full-time policemen, Mr. Sorrels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. There may have been, and probably was, some auxiliary police
which may have been along the route that the parade traveled on. I am not
sure about that.</p>

<p>They do have reserves that they call in. But those reserves, they are not
armed&mdash;they are in uniform, but they are not armed.</p>

<p>And my records do not show that there were auxiliary police there. But I
do know that they use them on occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Smith, if you have any questions on this aspect of our interview,
please feel free to ask them, because I am going to turn now to the actual
events of the day. I believe that the other advance preparations are covered
adequately for our purposes in Mr. Sorrel's memorandum, which I am about
to introduce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I have no questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Sorrels, I am going to mark this copy of your memorandum
Exhibit 4, Deposition of F.&nbsp;V. Sorrels, May 7, 1964.</p>

<p>Would you initial each page, please?</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Sorrels, I would like to turn now to the morning of November
22 and get from you an account of what you observed as a passenger in
the motorcade and thereafter.</p>

<p>In what car were you riding in the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I was riding in what we call the lead car, which is the one
immediately in front of the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was your function in the lead car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. To be there with the special agent who had made the survey,
and with the Chief of Police, and to observe the people and buildings as we
drove along in the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. One of your responsibilities was to observe the buildings and
the windows of the buildings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Looking for what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We always do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What would you be looking for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Anything that to us might mean danger.</p>

<p>For example, if someone had an object that appeared to be a gun, or something
like that&mdash;that, of course, would attract our attention. Or if someone
appeared to have something they were fixing to throw or toss, we definitely
would take cognizance of that immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall remarking on anything you observed in the windows
as you drove along Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, I do; there was a tremendous crowd on Main Street. The
street was full of people. I made the remark "My God, look at the people. They
are even hanging out the windows." Because I had observed many people in the
windows of the buildings as we were coming along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, as you made the right turn from Main Street onto Houston
Street, did you observe anything about the windows of any building in your
view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, I did. Of course the Court House is on the right-hand side,
and the windows there appeared to be closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. To the right-hand side of Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Of Houston Street; yes, sir.</p>

<p>The Book Depository, as we turned to the right on Houston Street, of course,
was right directly in front of us, and just to the left side of the street. I saw
that building, saw that there were some windows open, and that there were
some people looking from the windows. I remember distinctly there were a
couple of colored men that were in windows almost not quite to the center
of the building, probably two floors down from the top. There may have been
one or two other persons that I may have seen there. I don't recall any specific
instance. But I did not see any activity&mdash;no one moving around or anything
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you think you had an opportunity to view all the windows of
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I did, yes; because it was right in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall seeing anything on the side of the building to your
right, any of the windows on that side of the building&mdash;the far right side of
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. There was at least one or two windows that were open
in that section over there. I do not recall seeing anyone in any of those windows.
I do not, of course, remember seeing any object or anything like that in the
windows such as a rifle or anything pointing out the windows. There was
no activity, no one moving around that I saw at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But you believe you could observe all of the windows on the
side of the building facing you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. In other words, it is just right down at the end of the
street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, the car you were riding in was a closed car, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; it was a Ford sedan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you were in the rear seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Right rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did the roof of the car obscure your view at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But you were still able to observe the whole building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. Of course I was sitting close to&mdash;as far over to the right
as I could get, and I could look out the window. I could not, of course, look
up and see any building straight up, or over to my left I would not have been
able to see anything that was any higher than the view of the window on the
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You didn't have your head actually out of the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; I did not. But the glass was down in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As you turned into Houston Street, Mr. Sorrels, can you estimate
how far in front of the President's car the lead car was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, probably about 30 feet&mdash;fairly close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As you approached the Book Depository Building along Houston
Street, did your ability to see all of the building diminish because of the angle
of your vision and the roof of the car coming in the way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, it would have. The closer you got to it, looking out from
the front part of the car, naturally your vision would diminish as you approach.</p>

<p>But we turned to the left on Main Street, and at that time just glancing by,
I could see the side of the building from the window where I was sitting in
the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I believe you mean left onto Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Elm Street&mdash;I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So that when you turned from Houston left onto Elm, you again
had a look at the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; you see, as you make the turn&mdash;of course, as we pulled
on down Elm Street, after having made the turn, it is actually more than a
right angle turn. It bends even more to the left. And you can, of course,
glance up like that as you go by. But as you go on by the building, the building
is getting away from you, and unless you would turn clear on around and look
out to the right, you would not be able to see the building after you got a little
distance down Elm Street there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you turn to your right and look at the building again as your
car negotiated this turn onto Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As the car was making the turn, yes, I was looking at the crowd,
and just glancing up at the building as we made the turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you believe that you saw all of the windows on the building
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As we were making the turn, yes, I would say that I saw all the
windows in the building&mdash;just looked at the windows as we made the turn.
But then I was looking at the people along the side of Elm Street, along each
side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you estimate, going back to the first turn into Houston Street,
how long an opportunity you had to observe the building, in time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. On Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes. As you turned right off Main onto Houston Street, the building
first came into view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long did you see the building before the roof obscured your
view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Of course I wasn't looking at it all the time. As we came to the
right on Houston Street, of course, the building loomed up in front, and I just
looked at it, and looking at the people along the side, and as we were making the
turn I was just glancing like that, and saw the building.</p>

<p>I saw nothing unusual or any activity at that time. And then after making
the turn, I did not look at the building any more, or in that direction, until after
the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Are you saying that you only glanced at the building then, because
you were looking at other things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. I looked at the building. I didn't study it intently and
look at that and nothing else around there. I looked at the building, didn't see
any activity, and looked at the people as we had been doing during the entire
motorcade route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would this have been a matter of several seconds or longer than
that, or can you estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think it would be a matter of seconds, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It is rather a large building, with a number of windows along that
side, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; it is a good-sized building. I believe it is seven stories
high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you think you had enough time, though, to see all the windows,
or is it a general impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Just a general impression.</p>

<p>In other words, I did not specifically study any specific window or anything
like that. It is just like you glance out and see the building there, you would
see some open windows, and maybe some people in them&mdash;that is all. There
wasn't any activity or anything like that that I saw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, as you turned left from Houston onto Elm and looked again
at the building, did you have as long a look this time as you had before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; because he was making a left-hand turn, and, of course,
getting in front of the building, I just glanced out&mdash;just as we made the turn,
just in a general way, you are looking at the crowd and the building, just a
glance at it at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And at this point you are traveling directly in front of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I imagine it would have been difficult to look up and see the whole
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I don't mean to say that after we made the turn I looked
up and saw the whole building. But just as we made the turn I looked towards
the building and saw people in front, and just glanced up&mdash;I would not say that
I saw the entire building at all at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And it is your testimony that you saw nothing unusual, that you
observed no one there with a weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Or any other implement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That several windows were open on the side of the building at
different places?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And that the only people you observed were at one particular
location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I recall distinctly about two floors down seeing two colored men
there at the windows. I do not recall seeing&mdash;specifically seeing anyone else.
There may have been some one other person over there. But I do not recall
specifically seeing anyone on the right-hand side of the building, where the
window was open. I do not recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And the location of the two Negro men that you observed was in
what part of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I would say that it was about, oh, maybe a third of the distance
from the right to the left, maybe not quite that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And about two stories down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. From the top; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And when did you observe these Negro men, when you first turned
into Houston, or when you turned from Houston onto Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I observed them first, when I first looked at the building I saw
them, and I don't recall that I actually saw them again after that. When we
were making the turn I glanced, and as you say, I would not have been able to
see, I don't think all the way to the top of the building, unless I put my head
almost out the window.</p>

<p>But I saw people out in front, and I would not say that I saw the people as I
was making the turn or subsequent to that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you looked at the crowd along Houston and Elm, did you
notice anything unusual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You have turned now onto Elm, Mr. Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Why don't you tell us now in your own words and in as much
detail as you remember exactly what you recall transpired next.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. The crowd had begun to thin out after we made the turn on
Elm Street there. As a matter of explanation, Elm Street goes at a downgrade&mdash;in
other words, as I said a moment ago, it makes more than a left-hand&mdash;oblique
left-hand turn. It curves back&mdash;I mean it is more of a sharp angle than a right
angle. And then it swings down a little curve to go into the underpass.</p>

<p>There is a sidewalk and terrace that goes up to the right, increasing in height
as you approach the underpass from the corner at Elm and Houston Streets.</p>

<p>We were running late, because the President arrived at Love Field late.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson was particularly concerned, as we all are, in keeping the schedule.</p>

<p>I looked back to see how close the President's car was in making the turn, because
we had begun to pick up speed after we made the left-hand turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Then I looked back to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How close was the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. At that time we were probably, oh, I would say, several car
lengths ahead of it, because we had begun to pick up speed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You think somewhat further than you estimated before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As we came around Houston, yes, sir; came around on Houston,
yes, because we had begun to pick up speed there. And I remember Mr. Lawson
turned around and said, "I wish he would come on, because we are late now,"
or words to that effect.</p>

<p>And I expressed to him, I said, "Oh, we are not going to be very late."</p>

<p>And I looked at my watch, and it was just about 12:30.</p>

<p>And I said, "We are not going to be over 5 minutes late," and the Chief of
Police, I believe, spoke up and said, "We are about 5 minutes away now."</p>

<p>And so they called on the radio to the Trade Mart that we were 5 minutes
away.</p>

<p>And it seemed like almost instantly after that, the first shot was heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, did you recognize it at the time as a shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I felt it was, because it was too sharp for a backfire of an automobile.
And, to me, it appeared a little bit too loud for a firecracker.</p>

<p>I just said, "What's that?" And turned around to look up on this terrace part
there, because the sound sounded like it came from the back and up in that
direction.</p>

<p>At that time, I did not look back up to the building, because it was way back
in the back.</p>

<p>Within about 3 seconds, there were two more similar reports. And I said,
Let's get out of here and looked back, all the way back, then, to where the
President's car was, and I saw some confusion, movement there, and the car
just seemed to lurch forward.</p>

<p>And, in the meantime, a motorcycle officer had run up on the right-hand side
and the chief yelled to him, "Anybody hurt?"</p>

<p>He said, "Yes."</p>

<p>He said, "Lead us to the hospital."</p>

<p>And the chief took his microphone and told them to alert the hospital, and said,
Surround the building. He didn't say what building. He just said, "Surround
the building." And by that time we had gotten almost in under the
underpass, and the President's car had come up and was almost abreast of us.</p>

<p>When I saw them get so close, I said, "Let's get out quick," or "Get going
fast," or something to that effect. In other words, I didn't want them to pass
us, because I knew we were supposed to be in front.</p>

<p>And that is when they floor-boarded the accelerator on the police car and we
got out in front. And someone yelled loudly to go to the nearest hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Let's stop there and go back, and then we will pick up again.</p>

<p>You testified that you heard three reports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Are you pretty certain about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And no more and no fewer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you you tell us anything about the spacing of these reports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. There was to me about twice as much time between the
first and second shots as there was between the second and third shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you estimate the overall time from the first shot to the third
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. I have called it out to myself, I have timed it, and I
would say it was very, very close to 6 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It sounds like you can still hear the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I will hear them forever&mdash;it is something I cannot wipe from
my mind ever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you had little doubt that this was gunfire at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. After&mdash;as I said before, on the first shot, it was too sharp to
be a backfire of an automobile. It just didn't sound like that at all. And
then, of course, the other two coming as quickly as they did, and the confusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
there was no question, because I said, "Get out of here," meaning to move out,
because certainly if there is anything going on like that, we don't want to even
be stationary or near stationary&mdash;it is to get out of the vicinity as quickly as
we can from the source of danger. I thought in my mind&mdash;my thought was that
I should maybe get out to try to help apprehend who it was and so forth. There
was no chance for that, because we were moving too fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, as to the apparent source of these reports, did you feel
that all three reports came from the same direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. Definitely so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And that direction, as nearly as you can place it, was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. To the right and back. That is about the only way I can
express it.</p>

<p>And, as I said, the noise from the shots sounded like they may have come back
up on the terrace there. And that is the reason I was looking around like that
when the first shot. And I continued to look out until the other two shots. And
then I turned on around and looked back to where the President's car was, and
that is when I saw some movement there, and the car just seemed to leap
forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you looked at the terrace to the right of Elm Street, did
you observe any unusual movement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I didn't see anything unusual at that time.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you looking at that terrace when either the second or third
shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; I was. And I saw just some movement of some people,
but no firearms or anything like that, because we began to move out rather
rapidly. And we were quite a ways down the street at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How do you mean movement of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It seems I recall someone turned around and was going in the
other direction, like moving away from the street. And that is all I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But you didn't observe anything that led you to feel that the
shots might have been fired from that terrace there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It sounded to you at first as though it came from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is the way it sounded&mdash;back into the rear and to the right,
back up in that direction. And in the direction, of course, of the building.</p>

<p>But the reports seemed to be so loud, that it sounded like to me&mdash;in other
words, that was my first thought, somebody up on the terrace, and that is the
reason I looked there.</p>

<p>As we were approaching the overpass there, Mr. Lawson remarked that there
was an officer on the overpass there. I saw a police officer standing there, with
two or three other persons over to his right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Where is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. On the overpass, on Elm Street, after we leave the corner of Elm
and Houston.</p>

<p>There was no activity there. They were just standing there.</p>

<p>And I remarked, as I recall. "A policeman is there," or words to that effect,
because Mr. Lawson had been checking, as well as myself, all of the overpasses,
to see that the officer was there, because that is one of the specific things that
was checked all the way through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you observed nothing unusual on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were the people on the overpass in a fairly tight group, or spread
out over the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, the police officer was about the center of the overpass
on Elm Street, and then to his right&mdash;I mean to my right which would have
been his left, there seemed to be, as I recall it, about three other persons up
there that appeared to be workmen or dressed like that, and they were to his
right.</p>

<p>They were not right close together, but standing within walking distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As far as you can recall, were all the people you saw on the overpass
within the sight of the policeman on the overpass?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes; they were in the same vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you have any reason to believe that any of these shots might
have come from the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. None whatsoever; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And are you certain in your own mind that they did not come
from the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you have any reason to believe that the shots could not have
come from the Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would shots from the Book Depository Building have been consistent
with your hearing of the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; they would have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What happened next, Mr. Sorrels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We proceeded to Parkland Hospital just as fast as we could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you go into the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I did not go into the hospital.</p>

<p>Of course the lead car was in front. We went around to the emergency
entrance. I jumped out of the car, and I expected to see stretchers there, out
waiting, but they were not. And I ran to the entrance door there, and at that
time they began to bring stretchers out, and I said, "Hurry up and get those
stretchers out," and someone else, probably one of the police officers, also said
to hurry up and get the stretchers out.</p>

<p>There was a lot of confusion around at that time.</p>

<p>And they did get the stretchers out. And then Mr. Johnson&mdash;they brought
him into the hospital, he rushed into the hospital. And they took Mr. Connally
in, loaded him first, and then the President, and just as quick as they got in there,
I immediately went into a police car that was leaving and asked them to take me
to the building as fast as they could, and when I said the building I meant the
one on the corner there, which was the Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Why did you designate the Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Because I wanted to get there and get something going in
establishing who the people were that were in that vicinity. And upon arrival
at the Book Store, we pulled up on the side, and I went in the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Just a minute. Had you heard any mention of the Book Depository
on police broadcasts as you drove to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I never heard anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And, at this point, you were not certain that the shots came from
the Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I didn't know at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You just wanted to get to that general area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; because I knew that there would be witnesses around
there, there would have to be somebody in that vicinity.</p>

<p>And upon arrival at the Book Depository, I went in the back door.</p>

<p>There were people moving around.</p>

<p>I asked, "Where is the manager here?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Just a minute.</p>

<p>How much time do you think elapsed from the time the shots were fired until
the time you returned to the Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don't believe it could have been over about 20 minutes, because
we went to the hospital just as fast as we possibly could, and I wasn't there
very long.</p>

<p>And we came back as fast as we could.</p>

<p>Of course we didn't get back as fast as we went out there, because traffic
was moving.</p>

<p>The other way it was just cleared out to the Trade Mart. We had clear
sailing from the time that the shots were fired until we got to the Trade Mart,
because that was the route that we were going to go anyway. And that was
cleared out.</p>

<p>But coming back, of course, there was traffic. We did come back under lights
and siren, as fast as we could.</p>

<p>But there was traffic that slowed us up some.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So you estimate not more than 20 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don't believe it could have been more than 20 or 25 minutes
at the very most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then you arrived at the Book Depository Building, and did you
see any police officers outside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; there were officers. I recall seeing officers. I could not
say any specific one.</p>

<p>Now, as I came into the back of the building, there was a colored man standing
on the rear platform, a loading platform. And he was just standing there
looking off into the distance. I don't think he knew what happened.</p>

<p>And I said to him, "Did you see anyone run out the back?"</p>

<p>He said, "No, sir."</p>

<p>Did you see anyone leave the back way?</p>

<p>No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you get his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; I did not. I did not stop to do that, because I figured
he was an employee of the building.</p>

<p>I went on the inside of the building and asked someone for the manager and
they pointed to Mr. Truly.</p>

<p>I identified myself to Mr. Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Just a minute.</p>

<p>Did you establish how long that man had been on the loading platform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. There was no policeman stationed at the loading platform when
you came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I did not see one; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you were able to enter the building without identifying
yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then you got inside the building and what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I asked for the manager, and I was directed to Mr. Truly. He
was standing there.</p>

<p>I went up and identified myself to him. I said, "I want to get a stenographer,
and we would like to have you put down the names and addresses of every
employee of the building, in the building."</p>

<p>And I then walked on out the front door and asked, "Did anyone here see
anything?"</p>

<p>And someone pointed to Mr. Brennan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was your purpose in asking for a list of the employees of
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Because I knew that they would have to be interviewed. I was
trying to establish at that time without any delay, who all was in that building
or was employed there, because I knew they would have to be talked to later.</p>

<p>In other words, I was looking for someone that saw something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You were looking for potential witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And at that time you had no basis for suspecting any employee
might be involved one way or the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir; and I did not know at that time that the shots came from
the building.</p>

<p>When I was&mdash;when Mr. Brennan was pointed out to me, I went up and told him
who I was and asked him if he saw anything. And he told me what he
had seen. And, at that time, that is the first time that I knew definitely that
any shots had come from the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, what precisely did Mr. Brennan tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Mr. Brennan said that he was standing across the street, watching
the parade, and that he, of course, was looking in the direction where the
President was, and he heard a sound which he thought at first was a backfire
of an automobile. And that shortly afterwards there was another sound, and
that he thought that somebody might be throwing firecrackers out of the
building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
And he glanced up to the building, and that he saw a man at the window on
the right-hand side, the second floor from the top.</p>

<p>And he said, "I could see the man taking deliberate aim and saw him fire
the third shot," and said then he just pulled the rifle back in and moved back
from the window, just as unconcerned as could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How did you happen to talk to Mr. Brennan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I asked&mdash;I don't know who, someone there&mdash;"Is there anyone here
that saw anything?" And someone said, "That man over there."</p>

<p>He was out in front of the building and I went right to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did Mr. Brennan tell you anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I asked him whether or not he thought he could identify the
person that he saw, and he, of course, gave me a description of him, said that
he appeared to be a slender man, he had on what appeared to be a light jacket
or shirt or something to that effect, and that he thought he could identify him&mdash;said
he was slender build. Because I was definitely interested in someone that
had seen something that could give us some definite information.</p>

<p>And I also asked if he had seen anybody else, and he pointed to a young
colored boy there, by the name of Euins. And I got him and Mr. Brennan, and
I took them over to the sheriff's office where we could get statements from them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was the name of that young man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Euins, I believe it is, or pretty close to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you interview Mr. Euins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; I did. And he also said that he had heard the noise
there, and that he had looked up and saw the man at the window with the rifle,
and I asked him if he could identify the person, and he said, no, he couldn't,
he said he couldn't tell whether he was colored or white.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you remember anything unusual about the way Mr. Brennan
was dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He was dressed as a workman, or a laborer, and he had on a
hard hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Construction hat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did Mr. Brennan tell you anything else about anything else he
had observed at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I can't recall any specific thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he mention seeing any other person or persons in the windows
of the Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don't recall whether he did or did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he say anything about observing anyone leave the Book Depository
Building hurriedly after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he point out to you precisely the window from which he said
he saw the shot fired, the window in which he saw the sniper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Where was that window in relation to the windows at which you
saw several Negro men as you drove on Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It was one floor above and a little bit to the right, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you give us these directions in terms of compass points?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. That would be on the east side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So the window that Mr. Brennan pointed out to you was on the
extreme east side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And the window or windows at which you had observed several
Negro men was more to the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. A little bit more to the west&mdash;not very much&mdash;but to the west,
on the floor below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Are you certain in your mind about the floor below?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is there any particular reason for that? You said before that
you essentially glanced at the building, and didn't have very long to observe it,
and you saw these men at the window.</p>

<p>What makes you certain about placing the men on any particular floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Well, because I remember that they were not near the top&mdash;I
can just remember that&mdash;it seemed to me like two floors down from the top,
as I recall having seen them. And, of course, when I got back to the building
down there, there were windows open on the floor below at the place where I
recall having seen the colored men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So it was the open window afterwards that helped you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And are you certain that those were the same open windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, I think they were. I don't have any reason to think
otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then you accompanied Brennan and Euins where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. To the sheriff's office, which was right across the street from
the Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you have any further conversation with them on the way
over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes; we discussed&mdash;I was talking to him on the way over
there about what they saw and observed, and told them we would like to come
in there where we could get their statements down in writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did they tell you anything that you have not already told us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>The little colored boy mentioned he was there with another colored boy that
ran off when this thing happened&mdash;at the first shot this boy ran off. He said
he stayed there, but the other boy ran off. I didn't make any effort to get in
touch with him, because he apparently saw nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then you took them into the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was going on in the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. At that time one of the deputy sheriffs was in the interrogation
room taking a statement from some witness there. And I did not want to just
stay there and wait too long, so I asked him would he also write up the statements
on it&mdash;Mr. Brennan and the colored boy. And I then started out in the
hall of the sheriff's office there with the idea of going back to see if I could
locate other witnesses, when Chief Deputy Sheriff Mr. Allan Sweatt told me
there was another witness across the hallway, near Mr. Sweatt's office&mdash;he is the
polygraph operator there, and his office is not in the same area as the sheriff's
office but across the hall&mdash;that there was an FBI agent taking a statement
over there from a person.</p>

<p>So I accompanied him over there and hadn't been in there but just a few
minutes until Mr. Sweatt came and called me out and says "Forrest, there are
some people here I think you ought to talk to."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Whose statement was being taken by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don't recall. And, at that <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall what their statement was&mdash;what their testimony
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I don't, because I wasn't in there but just a very short time.
And this FBI agent was questioning about what they had seen and so forth.
I don't recall&mdash;it was being taken down at the time.</p>

<p>So I went out, and they had Mr. and Mrs. Arnold there. And Mr. Arnold, a
young man, and his wife, very young, said that they were standing on the side
of the street on Houston Street, there by the courthouse building, and that
they&mdash;this is prior to the time of the arrival of the President there, some 20 to 25
minutes beforehand, he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This is the east side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That would be the east side of Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Are you certain about the name of this couple? I believe you
said Arnold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Could that have been his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, that could have been his first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you recall his second name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I would know it if I heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Could it have been Roland?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, Roland is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did they tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He said that they were standing there waiting for the President
to come by, and they were talking about security. And he said that right
after that, that he looked up at this building over there, which is the Book
Depository, and that there were a couple of windows open towards the west
side, and that he saw a man standing in there with what appeared to be a
rifle with a telescopic sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Towards the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes&mdash;two windows towards the west side.</p>

<p>And that he remarked to his wife, "I guess that is a Secret Service man."</p>

<p>And I asked her if she saw it, and she said, no, that she had left her glasses
home, and she is nearsighted, and she could not see him. And, of course, I
asked him the description of the man. I asked him "How could you determine&mdash;what
made you think it had a telescopic sight on it?"</p>

<p>He said, "Well, it seemed like it was wider on the light background."</p>

<p>I said, "How was he holding it?"</p>

<p>He said, port arms&mdash;he was standing several feet back away from the window.</p>

<p>And I asked him, "Could you identify that man?"</p>

<p>He said, "No, I could not."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did Mrs. Roland confirm that he had discussed this with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. She confirmed the conversation, but she said she could not see
anything, because she didn't have her glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did Mr. Roland tell you he had seen anyone else in the windows
of the Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I don't recall that he did. I don't recall that at all. He may
have, but I don't recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he mention anyone on the sixth floor, and particularly on
the extreme east side of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I don't recall that he mentioned anyone there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was your impression of what he told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Well, of course, the thing that hit me first thing is why&mdash;he
was right there by the sheriff's office, if he had just gone in there and said,
Look, I saw a man with a rifle over there.</p>

<p>I said, "Why didn't you say something to somebody about it?"</p>

<p>He said, "I just thought he was a Secret Service man."</p>

<p>And at that time he appeared to be, as far as I was concerned, truthful
about the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You didn't have any reason to doubt him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And would the same be true of what Mr. Brennan told you,
and Euins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you look towards the window that Roland had pointed out
from the spot at which he said he was standing, to see whether it was possible
to observe from there someone standing several feet back from the window?
Did you have occasion to check that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Well, no, not specifically.</p>

<p>Later on I heard that he had&mdash;I believe in his statement that he wrote up down
there at the sheriff's office, something about 15 feet back. And I thought to myself,
well, I don't think you could see anybody that far back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But he didn't tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, he just said he was standing back of the window there,
just kind of looking around there. He said after he saw him there, he didn't
pay any more attention, because he just thought it was a Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. There was another witness there that I started talking to&mdash;I
don't recall the name now, because I told him to go in&mdash;somebody that saw
a truck down there&mdash;this is before the parade ever got there&mdash;that apparently
had stalled down there on Elm Street. And I later checked on that, and found
out that the car had gone dead, apparently belonged to some construction company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
and that a police officer had come down there, and they had gone to the
construction company and gotten somebody to come down and get the car out
of the way.</p>

<p>Apparently it was just a car stalled down there.</p>

<p>But this lady said she thought she saw somebody that looked like they had
a guncase. But then I didn't pursue that any further&mdash;because then I had
gotten the information that the rifle had been found in the building and shells
and so forth.</p>

<p>At that time Mr. Harry McCormack, who is a reporter for the Dallas Morning
News, and whom I have known for many years, came to me and says, "Forrest,
I have something over here you ought to know about."</p>

<p>I said, "What have you got here?"</p>

<p>He said, "I have a man over here that got pictures of this whole thing."</p>

<p>I said, "Let's go see him."</p>

<p>So we went on to a building at the corner of Elm and Houston, on the east
side of Houston, and across the street from the court house building there, and
up to the office of a Mr. Zapruder, they have a dress manufacturing place there
in that building. And he was there with another man connected with the business
there, and apparently some magazine representatives there. And Mr.
Zapruder was real shook up. He said that he didn't know how in the world
he had taken these pictures, that he was down there and was taking the thing
there, and he says, "My God, I saw the whole thing. I saw the man's brains
come out of his head."</p>

<p>And so I asked Mr. Zapruder would it be possible for us to get a copy of
those films.</p>

<p>He said, yes.</p>

<p>So then accompanied by Mr. Zapruder, and this other gentleman in the business
there with him, whose name I don't recall at the moment, and Mr. McCormack,
we went then to the Dallas Morning News Building, which is about
three blocks from Mr. Zapruder's building, three or four blocks from there, with
the idea of getting those films developed right away.</p>

<p>There was no one there that would tackle the job. We then went to the
television section, WFAA, of the Dallas Morning News, to see if we could get
them to handle it there, and they said, no, they would not attempt to do that,
but they did assist us by calling Eastman Kodak Co., and they said if we came
out there right away, that they would get right on it.</p>

<p>We got a police car, and went right on out to the Eastman Kodak Co., and
while there I met another gentleman who had seen some still pictures, and I
arranged with him for us to get copies of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was his name&mdash;do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He is a salesman for the Ford Co. on West Commerce Street&mdash;Mr.
Willis.</p>

<p>And so he said, yes, that he would be glad to furnish me with a copy of the
pictures.</p>

<p>At that time, I made a phone call to my office, because I had not been in
contact with them since we had departed from Love Field. I was informed
that an FBI agent had called the office and said that Captain Fritz of the
Homicide Bureau had been trying to get in touch with me, that he had a
suspect in custody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That would be fairly close to 2 o'clock, I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. About an hour after you had <span class="locked">returned&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. I would say that it was at least that long&mdash;maybe a little
bit longer.</p>

<p>So when I got that information, I told Mr. Zapruder that I would contact
him later and get the pictures, because I wanted to get right down to Captain
Fritz' office.</p>

<p>So I left then with the same police car and had them take me to Captain
Fritz' office.</p>

<p>And upon arrival there, there was many officers around there, there was
already cameras out in the hall, tripods, and so forth, and all of the city hall
down there. And there was a number of officers in the detective bureau office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
there, and Captain Fritz' office, which is an office within the large office,
was closed, and the blinds were drawn in his office there.</p>

<p>I did not knock on the door or anything, because I did not want to interfere
with him if he was talking to someone. So I just waited there until Captain
Fritz opened the door, and he had a man who I later found out to be Oswald
in custody at the time.</p>

<p>And I told Captain Fritz, I said, "Captain, I would like to talk to this man
when I have an opportunity."</p>

<p>He said, "You can talk to him right now."</p>

<p>And he just took him on back around to the side of Captain Fritz' office, and
there was a number of other officers there, might have been some FBI agents,
too, there, because there were numbers of FBI agents around in that vicinity
almost all the time from that time on. And some of the detectives there.</p>

<p>And I started talking to Oswald, started asking him some questions, and
he was arrogant and a belligerent attitude about him.</p>

<p>And he said to me, "I don't know who you fellows are, a bunch of cops."</p>

<p>And I said, "Well, I will tell you who I am. My name is Sorrels and I am
with the United States Secret Service, and here is my commission book."</p>

<p>I held it out in front of him and he said, "I don't want to look at it."</p>

<p>And he held his head up and wouldn't look at it at all. And he said, "What
am I going to be charged with? Why am I being held here? Isn't someone
supposed to tell me what my rights are?"</p>

<p>I said, "Yes, I will tell you what your rights are. Your rights are the same
as that of any American citizen. You do not have to make a statement unless
you want to. You have the right to get an attorney."</p>

<p>Aren't you supposed to get me an attorney?</p>

<p>No, I am not supposed to get you an attorney.</p>

<p>Aren't you supposed to get me an attorney?</p>

<p>I said, "No, I am not supposed to get you an attorney, because if I got you
an attorney, they would say I was probably getting a rakeoff on the fee," or
words to that effect, and kind of smiled and tried to break the ice a little bit
there.</p>

<p>I said, "You can have the telephone book and you can call anybody you want
to."</p>

<p>I said, "I just want to ask you some questions. I am in on this investigation.
I just want to ask you some questions."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was there anything further said about an attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I recall at that time. I don't recall anything further
said about an attorney. I asked him where he worked. He told me worked
at this Book Depository. And as I recall it, I asked him what his address was,
and where he was living, and he explained to me that he was living apart from
his wife, and that she was living over in Irving, Tex. I asked him, as I recall
it, what his duties were at this Book Depository, and he said filling orders.</p>

<p>I asked him if he had occasion to be on more than one floor, and he said, yes.</p>

<p>I asked him if he had occasion to be on the sixth floor of the building. He
said, yes, because they fill orders from all the floors.</p>

<p>But he said most of his activity was down on the first floor.</p>

<p>And I think I asked him whether or not he had ever been in a foreign country,
and he said that he had traveled in Europe, but more time had been spent in
the Soviet Union, as I recall it.</p>

<p>And then he just said "I don't care to answer any more questions."</p>

<p>And so the conversation was terminated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he give you his address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, he did give me an address. I don't remember
what it was offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then were you finished with your questions, or did he refuse to
answer any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He just said, "I don't care to answer any more questions."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You wanted to ask him other questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And what happened then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He was taken by the officers, as I recall it, and was taken out
of that area and I suppose put back in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you then talk to Captain Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. As I recall it, I asked Captain Fritz whether or not he
had gotten anything out of him or not, and Captain Fritz said that he hadn't
been able&mdash;that he had not made any admissions or anything like that at that
time, and that he was going to talk to him again.</p>

<p>That is all I recall that transpired at that time.</p>

<p>Of course I contacted the Chief's office, when I got that information as to
who he was, and gave that information to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This is Chief Rowley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think I talked to Deputy Chief Paterni.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Of the Secret Service here in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did anything else transpire between that time and the Friday
night showup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I did not talk to Oswald again, and I was around there. When
I contacted Washington, I was informed that Inspector Kelley was being directed
to be there, and he would be there later on that evening, that they had caught
him out on the road, and he would come there to help out.</p>

<p>I also got information to Captain Fritz that I had this witness, Brennan,
that I had talked to, and that I would like very much for him to get a chance
to see Oswald in a lineup. And Captain Fritz said that would be fine.</p>

<p>So I instructed Special Agent Patterson, I believe it was, after I had located
Brennan&mdash;had quite a difficult time to locate him, because he wasn't at home.
And they finally prevailed upon his wife to try to help me locate him, and she,
as I recall it, said that she would see if she could locate him by phone. I called
her, I believe, the second time and finally got a phone number and called him
and told him we would like for him to come down and arrange for him to meet
one of our agents to pick him up at the place there. And when they came down
there with him, I got ahold of Captain Fritz and told him that the witness was
there, Mr. Brennan.</p>

<p>He said, "I wish he would have been here a little sooner, we just got through
with a lineup. But we will get another fixed up."</p>

<p>So I took Mr. Brennan, and we went to the assembly room, which is also
where they have the lineup, and Mr. Brennan, upon arrival at the police station,
said, "I don't know if I can do you any good or not, because I have seen the
man that they have under arrest on television," and he said, "I just don't know
whether I can identify him positively or not" because he said that the man on
television was a bit disheveled and his shirt was open or something like that,
and he said "The man I saw was not in that condition."</p>

<p>So when we got to the assembly room, Mr. Brennan said he would like to
get quite a ways back, because he would like to get as close to the distance
away from where he saw this man at the time that the shooting took place as
he could.</p>

<p>And I said, "Well, we will get you clear on to the back and then we can
move up forward."</p>

<p>They did bring Oswald in in a lineup.</p>

<p>He looked very carefully, and then we moved him up closer and so forth, and
he said, "I cannot positively say."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, is there anyone there that looks like him?"</p>

<p>He said, "Well, that second man from the left," who was Oswald&mdash;"he looks
like him."</p>

<p>Then he repeated that the man he saw was not disheveled.</p>

<p>Now, mind you, Oswald had a slight wound over here, and he had a black
eye, a bruised eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you say "over <span class="locked">here"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, on the left side. He had a mark on his forehead, and his
left eye was a bit puffed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How many other people were in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, there were five. In other words, all told there
was five or six&mdash;I don't remember. I believe there were five.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were the others reasonably similar to Oswald in height and
physical appearance, and color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Dress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I noted that to me I thought it was a very fair lineup, because
they didn't have anyone that was a lot taller than he was, or anyone a lot
shorter. They didn't have any big fat ones or anything like that.</p>

<p>In other words, to me it was a good lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. At that time, did Mr. Brennan say anything else to you that
you have not told us, or to anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I recall. He says, "I am sorry, but I can't do it. I
was afraid seeing the television might have messed me up. I just can't be
positive. I am sorry."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As far as you know, had Mr. Brennan been interviewed by anyone
after he gave his statement to the deputy sheriff until the time you had
him brought to the police headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was he then interviewed by anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you arrange for him to return to his home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As I recall it, I did. I told him "they will take you back to
your home."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Immediately after the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Have you ever spoken to Mr. Brennan again after that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We were assisting the Commission in locating witnesses to come
to Washington, to the Commission, and I got in touch with him and arranged
for him to go and procured his ticket and delivered his ticket to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And when you talked to him then, did he say anything that bears
upon our inquiry that he hadn't said before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Sorrels, when you were at the police headquarters, after this
interview with Oswald that you have told us about, do you recall talking to
any representative of the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Now, let's get that question again, because I talked to them
several times down there.</p>

<p>When was that you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. After you interviewed Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Oh, yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you know an FBI agent attached to the Dallas office named
James Hosty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you talk to Mr. Hosty that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I recall; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Might you have spoken to him, or do you think you would remember
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think I would remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall his being there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I think I saw him there.</p>

<p>Now, whether it was on the 22d or not, but I think during along this period,
I saw him there one time.</p>

<p>But I don't recall talking to Mr. Hosty at all down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did any of the agents attached to your office tell you that they
had talked to Hosty? Or that Hosty had told them anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; I think Special Agent Patterson, I believe, said that he
had seen Hosty down there, and that Hosty, I believe, had said that he had a
file on Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall anything else that Agent Patterson told you that
Mr. Hosty had told him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No; I cannot recall anything else. Because I had information&mdash;had
also gotten information from others. In other words, there was general
information around the Police Department there that the FBI had a file on
this individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Any other of your agents tell you that Hosty had said anything
to them about Oswald that you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. You mean at that specific date, regarding that specific date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Either on Friday or on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No. During the course of this thing, it was my understanding
that&mdash;I don't remember how the information came to me&mdash;that Hosty had been
checking on this Oswald, and that they had information or knew that he was
in this building. I cannot pinpoint it any way specifically, because the information
came several different times to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, you told us something of Oswald's physical appearance
when you saw him at the interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And at the showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did his appearance change in the course of that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Over that 3-day period, did you see any sign that force or any
other form of coercion was used on Oswald by anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you observe or hear of any intimidation of Oswald or the
offer of any benefit to Oswald if he were to confess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you participate in or observe any other interrogation of
Oswald following your own brief interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. On the following <span class="locked">day&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That is Saturday, the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; I sat in on part of an interview with him, with Captain
Fritz. And then, again, on Sunday the 24th, just before he was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did the question of counsel come up again&mdash;that is, a lawyer
for Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. During the interview with Captain Fritz, when I was in
there, he mentioned the fact that he wanted to get a man by the name of Abt,
or some similar name like that. I never had heard of him before. Apt, or
some similar name.</p>

<p>And Captain Fritz said, "Well, you can use the phone and you can call him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That was Saturday morning. And it is my understanding that
Oswald did attempt to reach this man on the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But you didn't observe it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I did not observe that; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you hear him mention at any time a lawyer from the American
Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. He said if he could not get this man&mdash;I wish I could
remember his name&mdash;a very short name, Apt or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. A-b-t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, A-b-t. Yes&mdash;if he couldn't get him, he wanted a lawyer
supplied by the Civil Liberties Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What else occurred at the interview on Saturday that you can
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He was questioned about the rifle, because, at that time, as I
recall it, it had been determined that the rifle had been purchased from Kleins
in Chicago, and shipped to a person using the name of A. Hidell. And he was
questioned by Captain Fritz along those lines. And he denied that the rifle
was his. He denied knowing or using the name of A. Hidell, or Alek Hidell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
He was, of course, questioned about his background and he at that time still
maintained an arrogant, defiant attitude. The questions were, of course,
directed towards getting information. A lot of them he would not answer.
And a lot of the answers, of course, were apparent falsehoods.</p>

<p>And he gave me the impression of lying to Captain Fritz, and deliberately
doing so, maybe with an attempt to get Captain Fritz to become angered, because
he, Oswald, would flare up in an angry manner from time to time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But you think that was acting&mdash;not genuine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. That is the impression I got, that he was just deliberately doing
that, possibly to agitate Captain Fritz and maybe get him to become angry,
and maybe do or say something that he shouldn't do.</p>

<p>That is just the impression I gained from him. And the reason&mdash;I guess one
reason I gained that impression is because on the last interview, on Sunday
morning, Oswald seemed to have taken a little bit different attitude. In other
words, he was talking a little bit freer&mdash;he wasn't giving out any information
of any value particularly, but he wasn't flaring up like he did before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was that Sunday interview extended beyond any time that
you know of that it was scheduled to end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes; it was, because the papers seemed to have gotten the
impression that he was going to be moved at exactly 10 o'clock in the morning,
and Captain Fritz was talking to him even after 11 o'clock in the morning&mdash;we
were still there. And I recall that Chief Curry came around and asked
Captain Fritz how long he was going to be, or what was holding it up, or something
like that, that they wanted to go ahead and get him moved as quick as
they could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did be indicate or did you understand that they wanted to move
him at 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. It was after 10 o'clock then, considerably. As a matter of
fact, it was after 11 at that time. Captain Fritz remarked to me afterwards,
he said, "Well, as long as it looks like he might talk, I hesitate to quit, or move
him out at that time," and he told Chief Curry, "We will be through in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>And shortly after that, Captain Fritz asked if anyone wanted to ask him any
questions, and, at that time, the postal inspector had obtained a change of
address card which Oswald had apparently filled out in which one of the names
shown on that change of address card that was to receive mail at that particular
address in New Orleans was named A. Hidell. And I desired to question Oswald
about that thing, because he had denied purchasing this rifle under the name
of A. Hidell, and he denied knowing anybody by the name of A. Hidell.</p>

<p>So I showed Oswald this change of address card and said to him, "Now, here
is a change of address card that you filed in New Orleans," and he looked at it.</p>

<p>He did not deny that he had filed the card, because it was apparently in his
handwriting, and his signature. And I said, "Now you say that you have not
used the name of A. Hidell, but you show it on this card here as the name
of A. Hidell, as a person to receive mail at this address. If you do not know
anyone by that name, why would you have that name on that card?"</p>

<p>He said, "I never used the name of Hidell."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That was the last question he was asked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. As far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. He was told that they were going to move him to the county jail,
and he requested that he be permitted to get a shirt out of his&mdash;the clothes that
had been brought in, that belonged to him, because the shirt he was wearing at
the time he had been apprehended was taken, apparently for laboratory examination.
And so Captain Fritz sent and got his clothes and, as I recall it, he
selected a dark colored kind of a sweater type shirt, as I recall it. And then
he was taken out, and, at that time, as I recall it, Inspector Kelley and I left
and went up to&mdash;I say up&mdash;down the hall to the executive office area of the
police department, and to the office of Deputy Chief Batchelor.</p>

<p>And we remained in that vicinity. I looked out the window, and saw the
people across the street, on Commerce Street, people were waiting there. And
I saw an individual that I know by the name of Ruby Goldstein, who is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
as Honest Joe, that has a second-hand tool and pawnshop down on Elm Street, and
everyone around there knows him. He was leaning on the car looking over in
the direction of the ramp there at the police station. And we were just waiting
around there.</p>

<p>And for a few minutes I was talking to one of the police officers that was on
duty up there in that area. And he had made the remark, "talking about open
windows, I see one open across the street over there" at a building across the
street.</p>

<p>I looked over there. I didn't see any activity at the window. And we had
walked out into the reception area of the executive office of the Chief of Police
there when this same police officer said that he just heard that Oswald had got
shot in the stomach in the basement by Jack Rubin, as I understood at that
time, R-u-b-i-n&mdash;who was supposed to run a night club.</p>

<p>Inspector Kelley and I then went just as hurriedly as we could to the
basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As I understand it, Mr. Sorrels, you covered all the relevant information
from this point of time on with Mr. Hubert yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes. And actually back just a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is there anything that has occurred to you since your interview
with Mr. Hubert that you would like to add now, to amplify anything you said
yesterday to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. We were trying to establish something about the time yesterday
morning that this transpired and so forth. And I could not fix any exact time.</p>

<p>But knowing the fact that Oswald, I believe, is reported to have been shot
at 11:21, I believe it is, and the fact that when we got into the basement of
the City Hall there at a time when Oswald was still on the floor there, and was
being given artificial respiration, as I said yesterday, and I immediately called
my headquarters office in Washington and told them about Oswald being shot
by Jack Rubin, a night club operator. And they asked me, of course, to get
additional information and call them back.</p>

<p>And from that telephone call, which went through very rapidly, I went back
upstairs&mdash;didn't tarry there at all. And Oswald was still there when I left and
went back upstairs to Captain Fritz' office, because my thought was to talk to
this man Jack Rubin as fast as I could.</p>

<p>Captain Fritz was not there. They said he went to the hospital. I asked
where Ruby was. They said he was up on the fifth floor. I said I would like
to talk to him. And I was sent with an officer to the jail elevator, went right
on up there. <span class="locked">So&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Have you been able to establish the time of your phone call to
Deputy <span class="locked">Chief&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I have not been able to establish it. But after thinking the
thing over, and the fact that Oswald was still there at the time this call was
made, I would say that that phone call was probably made between 11:25 and
11:30, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. Sorrels had you discussed with any official of the Dallas Police the plans
to move Oswald during a scheduled daylight hour, before the move was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. When I heard that he was supposed to be moved at 10 o'clock in
the morning, I said to Captain Fritz&mdash;and as I recall this conversation&mdash;I said
to him, "Captain, I wouldn't move that man at an announced time. I would
take him out at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, when there is nobody around."</p>

<p>And Captain Fritz said, "Well, the chief has gone along with these people,"
talking about the press and television people, and said that he wanted to continue
going along with them and cooperating with them all he can. And that
was all that was said about that.</p>

<p>I did not make that suggestion, or have a conversation like that with Chief
Curry, as I recall, because I did not want to appear that I was trying to tell
them how to run their business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What were conditions like in the third floor corridor of police
headquarters from Friday through Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Mr. Stern, you would almost have to be there to see it, to actually
realize the conditions. The press and the television people just, as the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
goes, took over. I would almost every time I went up there, definitely
after the 22d, I would have to identify myself to get in past the entrance of the
elevator on the third floor, if I was going to the chief's office or the deputy
chief's office or Captain Fritz' office. You would have to elbow your way
through, and step over tripods and cables and wires, and every time almost that
I would come out of Captain Fritz's office, the minute the door opened, they
would flash on those bright lights, and I got where I just shadowed my eyes
when I walked down there to keep the light from shining in my eyes. They
had cables run through one of the deputy chief's office, right through the
windows from the street up the side of the building, across the floor, out to the
boxes where they could get power&mdash;they had wires running out of that, had
the wires taped down to keep people from actually falling or stumbling over the
wires. And it was just a condition that you can hardly explain. It was just
almost indescribable.</p>

<p>I know at one time when Mr. Jim Underwood of KRLD, that is the Dallas
Time Herald Television Station down there, was in Captain Fritz' office with
Jack Ruby's sister, and a lady friend of hers, trying to arrange for her to get up
to talk to Jack Ruby, that the police officer who was stationed at the door to
the detective's office had a terrific time keeping them&mdash;I thought they were
going to barge on in there. They were yelling like mad&mdash;because Mr. Underwood
was in there, and one of them was there yelling&mdash;"if he has got a right
to be in here, we have a right to be in there."</p>

<p>Just as loud as he could. And Mr. Underwood had to leave Captain Fritz'
office and say, "Listen, fellows, I am not going upstairs. I am trying to make
arrangements for this woman to see her brother&mdash;I am not going upstairs."</p>

<p>That was just the situation you were booked up against there.</p>

<p>And, of course, every time you would turn around, they would ask me something,
and I would say, "No comment, I don't have any comment to make."</p>

<p>And I don't think at any time you will see that there is any statement made
by the newspapers or television that we said anything because Mr. Kelley, the Inspector,
told me "Any information that is given out will have to come from Inspector
Peterson in Washington."</p>

<p>Finally, after they found out I would not say anything, they didn't bother me
any more.</p>

<p>Many times when I would be going into the third floor area there, they would
start to stop me, and a lot of the guys that would know me would say, "That is
Sorrels of the Secret Service."</p>

<p>That happened more than once.</p>

<p>And, of course, I would have to go ahead and identify myself. The officers
that were on duty that had seen me before would recognize me and pass me
through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Can you estimate how many press representatives there were in
that corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I am not too good in estimating anything like that, but there
were dozens of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was any effort made to restrict them to a far part of the corridor,
or to remove them from the floor entirely that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you ever learn why this was not done&mdash;did you ever ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, I did not. I just thought to myself&mdash;well, if this was being
handled in a Federal building, this situation would not exist. That is what
I thought.</p>

<p>But, of course, that is a public building. I thought to myself&mdash;well, they
are in here, and the chief would have a heck of a time getting them out. That
is just my own thoughts about the thing, because I do know that the Dallas
Police Department, the Dallas Sheriff's Office, they do try to go along with the
press and everything like that.</p>

<p>After this thing happened, Mr. Felix McKnight, who I mentioned before, who
is a personal friend of mine, executive editor of the Dallas Times Herald, he
said to me, "Forrest, those people should have been out of there, and that includes
us."</p>

<p>Of course the thing was all over then. I would imagine that Chief Curry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
or anybody else that would have tried to have gotten them out of there would
have really had a tough time and they probably would have really blasted them
in the press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Sorrels, that covers the ground that I wanted to ask you
about.</p>

<p>Is there anything you would like to add to anything you said this morning
with respect to the advance preparations, the actual events in front of the
Book Depository, your return there, anything that elapsed while you were
at the police headquarters from Friday afternoon through Sunday morning&mdash;or
with respect to anything you told Mr. Hubert about yesterday?</p>

<p>Just take a moment and think about it.</p>

<p>And if there is anything you would like to amplify or add to what you have
said that you think the Commission should know, please tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I cannot recall anything right now, Mr. Stern.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I would like you to identify this one page memorandum entitled
"Statement of Forrest V. Sorrels, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Secret Service,
Dallas, Tex., November 28, 1963."</p>

<p>I have marked this "Exhibit 5," deposition of F.&nbsp;V. Sorrels, May 7, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes, sir; that is a copy of a statement that I wrote up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you initial that for me, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you review the statement and see if there is anything
you would like to add to it?</p>

<p>I think you might just tell us what it covers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. This is a statement which was written up by me on November 28,
1963, relating the fact that the presidential <span class="locked">motorcade&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The statement will be in the record, Mr. Sorrels. I meant just
tell us the subject matter of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Relating to the events that I observed when the presidential
motorcade went from Love Field until the time that I left the Parkland Hospital
to go to the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is there anything you want to add to that statement that you
have not already told us&mdash;because we have gone into this in much greater
detail now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. No, not that I can recall, because as you say we went into it in
more detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Sorrels. We appreciate very much
your coming to Washington to help us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. I want to express my appreciation to you and to the Commission
for permitting me to not come on the week of the 19th, due to the fact
that my little daughter had to go to the hospital. I certainly appreciate your
consideration in letting me come at a later date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. We were very happy we could arrange that, and we are glad
to know she is well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sorrels</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kinds of products does Klein's sell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Sporting goods in the majority, with some few specialty items
which appeal to the male consumer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would these include goods such as fishing items or hunting items?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not included in the products
handled by Klein's are rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Would you restate the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does Klein's Sporting Goods, Inc., handle rifles in their line of
sporting goods?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. They do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For the record, we would like to have a little bit more of your
overall background. Were you originally born in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. No; I was born in Sedalia, Mo., November 16, 1912. Education:
I don't know just what you're after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you went through high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. I completed high school, attended Carnegie Institute of Technology,
New York University. I don't know the nature of how far you want
this developed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you had some college work then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And after you got out of college, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. I got out of college and I was employed by Sears and Roebuck,
Spiegel's, Inc., and various other employment, served in the U.S. Army, Air
Corps branch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is during World War II?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. During World War II. Following which I was employed
for a brief period in a family business, and subsequently by Klein's Sporting
Goods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, I hand you what is being marked as Waldman
Deposition Exhibit 1 and ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you please tell us what that statement constitutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This constitutes a purchase order of Klein's directed to
Crescent Firearms Co. for Italian Carcano rifles prepared on January 2, 19&mdash;,
oh, wait a minute; hold that a moment, January 24, 1963, calling for 200 units
at a cost of $8.50.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. I haven't finished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me just ask you this preliminary question: This is a photostatic
copy of a document, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And is the original copy, or was the original copy prepared by
someone under your direction or supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The original was prepared under a system which I originated
and this particular order was not prepared at my direction. It would be&mdash;the
merchandise was ordered in a routine basis at a time in which it was
needed, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who the person is that filled out this order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; his initials are so indicated as "M.&nbsp;W."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that be the name at the lower left-hand corner of Exhibit 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that is who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Mitchell W. Westra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At that time was he an employee of your company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. He was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he under your jurisdiction and supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. He was not under my direct supervision, no. He was under the
direct supervision of Sam Kasper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where is Sam Kasper now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. He may or may not be here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I don't mean this afternoon. Is he with the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. He is the vice president of our company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He is the other vice president of the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, you started to go into the detail of what Deposition
Exhibit 1 constituted. I just wonder if you will pick up where you left off
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; on the same form we show a record of the receipt of
the rifles in question, specifically this extreme right-hand column which is filled
in, indicating that on February 22, delivery was made to us by Lifschultz Trucking
Co. I might explain the difference in the two dates here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The February 21 date is the date in which the merchandise
came to our premises whereas the date of February 22, is the date in which they
were officially received by our receiving department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your receiving department checks each order to see that the
physical contents match the stated shipment on the invoice; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. They don't necessarily see that they match because they frequently
do not match, but they determine actually how much was received by us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I notice on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 1 a date&mdash;well,
I might read everything under the column of description; it says Italian Mannlicher-Carcano,
Model 91TS, bolt action 6-shot rifle; and then cal.&mdash;that's for
caliber&mdash;6.5, and then there is an "X" and 52 mm Italian-select, clean, and test-fired,
changed to Beretta Terni M19, then a slash line 38 EFF, and then the
date of 4/16/62. Explain that date and that description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; this general style of rifle was made by a number of different
manufacturers over a period of time and there were minor modifications
made by&mdash;developed by each of the manufacturers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this be similar to a number of manufacturers making the
Springfield rifle in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. As for example, the different manufacturers making the
Springfield rifle. Basically, the weapons were of the same general design, but
as I say, there were details that were different.</p>

<p>We originally had ordered one style of Carcano rifle, one that was known as
the Model 91TS. As time went on, we changed to another model known as the
Model 91/38EFF, this on April 13, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I also note on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 1, under the
item number&mdash;some letters here or <span class="locked">numbers&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. C20-T749.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What does that signify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is an identification number assigned by us for internal
operating purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this be something akin to a catalog number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Off the record now. Can I speak without <span class="locked">being&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, discussion was had off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the record.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Waldman, you just requested to go off the record and told me that
this is, the number that you read is not necessarily the only number that is
assigned to one of these model rifles. Do you ever have any other numbers assigned
to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What would be the occasion for assigning a different number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. When the rifle is offered and sold together with a scope and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
mount, we assign a different catalog number which describes the rifle, the scope
and the mount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever sell any of these particular rifles with scopes and
mounts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were these scopes and mounts purchased from the same source
as the rifle itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 1, does the date
April 13, 1962, have anything to do with the time with which you received orders
from customers of Klein's for any of these rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That date has no reference to our activity with consumers as
such. It only indicates in our buying of these rifles we changed from one model
to another, both models being very similar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Both being the Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5 caliber rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I'm going to hand you what has been marked as Waldman Deposition
Exhibit 2 and ask you to state if you know what that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is a delivery receipt from the Lifschultz Fast Freight
covering 10 cases of guns delivered to Klein's on February 21, 1963, from
Crescent Firearms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I note that there is some handwriting on Waldman Deposition
Exhibit No. 2 that says. "Klein's Sporting Goods, Inc., J.&nbsp;A. Mueller, 2-21-63."
Would that be one of your employees at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. He was. Mr. Mueller was in charge of our receiving department
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And do you know how many guns or rifles would have been packed
in each carton or case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Referring to the various delivery receipts, copies of which we
have, these are packing slips, incidentally, not receipts; these were packing receipts
included in each case. It was indicated there were 10 rifles in each case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I'm going to hand you what has been marked as Waldman Deposition
Exhibit No. 3 and ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; these are memos prepared by Crescent Firearms showing
serial numbers of rifles that were shipped to us and each one of these represents
those rifles that were contained in a case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you earlier mentioned that these were packed with the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Well, I would like to correct that. This particular company
does not include these with the cases, but sends these memos separately with
their invoice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, again, Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 3 is a photostatic
copy. Do you have the actual copies that came to you in front of you at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And is Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 3 an accurate photostat of
these other copies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice that there are numbers on each of these papers with 10
serial numbers each. I see here No. 3672, 3504 on the first photostat of Waldman
Deposition Exhibit No. 3. Do you see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I'm going to ask you to search through these 10 photostats and see
if you find any invoice number that has on it a serial number, C-2766.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Crescent Firearms delivery memo No. 3620 covering carton
or case No. 3376 does have a&mdash;indicate a rifle bearing serial No. 2766.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, is it 2766 or is there a prefix to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. There is a prefix, C-2766.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you see that as also a part of Waldman Deposition Exhibit
No. 3; I believe you are reading from the actual document in your possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
which Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 3 is a photostat of; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When a shipment of rifles is received, what is your procedure with
regard to recordkeeping on the serial numbers of the rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. We assign to each rifle a control number which is a number
used by us to record the history of the gun while it is in our possession and until
it is sold, thus each rifle will be tagged with both this control number and with
the serial number of the rifle which is stamped on the&mdash;imprinted on the gun by
the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have the same&mdash;does the same manufacturer give different
serial numbers for each weapon that the manufacturer makes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The gun manufacturers imprint a different number on each
gun. It's stamped into the frame of the gun and serves as a unique identification
for each gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I hand you what has been marked as Waldman Deposition
Exhibit No. 4 and ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is the record created by us showing the control number
we have assigned to the gun together with the serial number that is imprinted in
the frame of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, this is a photostat, I believe, of records you have in front of
you on your desk right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you find anywhere on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 4 the
serial number C-2766?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what is your control number for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Our control number for that is VC-836.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I'm going to hand you what has been marked as Waldman
Deposition Exhibit No. 5 and ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is an invoice rendered us by Crescent Firearms on their
date February 7, 1963, for one hundred each 6.5 Italian rifles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything on that invoice that shows how the rifles were
shipped to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It's indicated as having been shipped by the North Penn
Transfer-Lifschultz and that there were 10 cases or cartons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does it show whether or not this invoice was paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It shows that payment was made on March 4, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, were you ever contacted by any law enforcement
agency about the disposition of this Mannlicher-Carcano rifle that had the serial
number C-2766 on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; on the night of November 22, 1963, the FBI contacted our
company in an effort to determine whether the gun had been in our possession
and, if so, what disposition we had made of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know how the FBI happened to contact you or your
company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The FBI had a record of a gun of this type and with this serial
number having been shipped to us by Crescent Firearms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you mean that Crescent Firearms gave the FBI this information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Well, I&mdash;I must assume that's the case. I don't know it for a
fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. What did you and your company do when you were
contacted by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. We met with the FBI in our offices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this on Friday evening, November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. On Friday evening, November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the FBI indicate at what time, what period that they felt you
might have received this rifle originally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. We were able to determine from our purchase records the date
in which the rifle had been received, and they also had a record of when it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
been shipped, so we knew the approximate date of receipt by us, and from that
we made&mdash;let's see, we examined our microfilm records which show orders from
mail order customers and related papers, and from this determined to whom the
gun had been shipped by us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are these microfilm records part of your customary recording of
transactions of your company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I'm handing you what has been marked as an FBI Exhibit D-77
and ask you if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is a microfilm record that&mdash;of mail order transactions
for a given period of time. It was turned over by us to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know when it was turned over to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It was turned over to them on November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you are reading from the carton containing that microfilm.
Do you know whose initials are on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; the initials on here are mine and they were put on the
date on which this was turned over to the FBI concerned with the investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have on your premises a machine for looking at the microfilm
prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you can make copies of the microfilm prints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if we can adjourn the deposition upstairs to take a look
at these records in the microfilm and get copies of the appropriate records that
you found on the evening of November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, the following proceedings were had at the microfilm machine.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, you have just put the microfilm which we call
D-77 into your viewer which is marked a Microfilm Reader-Printer, and you
have identified this as No. 270502, according to your records. Is this just a
record number of yours on this particular shipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's a number which we assign for identification purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And on the microfilm record, would you please state who it shows
this particular rifle was shipped to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Shipped to a Mr. A.&mdash;last name&mdash;H-i-d-e-l-l, Post Office Box
2915, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And does it show any serial number or control number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It shows shipment of a rifle bearing our control number VC-836
and serial number C-2766.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there a price shown for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Price is $19.95, plus $1.50 postage and handling, or a total of
$21.45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I see another number off to the left. What is this number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The number that you referred to, C20-T750 is a catalog
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And after that, there appears some words of identification or
description. Can you state what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The number designates an item which we sell, namely, an
Italian carbine, 6.5 caliber rifle with the 4X scope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there a date of shipment which appears on this microfilm
record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; the date of shipment was March 20, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does it show by what means it was shipped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It was shipped by parcel post as indicated by this circle
around the letters "PP."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does it show if any amount was enclosed with the order itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; the amount that was enclosed with the order was $21.45,
as designated on the right-hand side of this order blank here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Opposite the words "total amount enclosed"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything which indicates in what form you received the
money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; below the amount is shown the letters "MO" designating
money order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I see the extreme top of this microfilm, the date, March 13,
1963; to what does that refer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is an imprint made by our cash register indicating that
the remittance received from the customer was passed through our register
on that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And to the right of that, I see $21.45. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other record that you have in connection with the
shipment of this rifle other than the particular microfilm negative frame that
we are looking at right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. We have a&mdash;this microfilm record of a coupon clipped from
a portion of one of our advertisements, which indicates by writing of the customer
on the coupon that he ordered our catalog No. C20-T750; and he has shown
the price of the item, $19.95, and gives as his name A. Hidell, and his address
as Post Office Box 2915, in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else on that negative microfilm frame?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The coupon overlays the envelope in which the order was
mailed and this shows in the upper left-hand corner the return address of
A. Hidell, Post Office Box 2915, in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>There is a postmark of Dallas, Tex., and a postdate of March 12, 1963, indicating
that the order was mailed by airmail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Can you see the actual cancelled stamp in the upper right-hand
corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And the stamp itself says "United States Airmail"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And underneath that, someone has written "airmail"; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And someone has written it addressed to you; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And is it possible on this machine to make prints of these negatives?</p>

<p>(Whereupon, it was attempted to make copies of said documents.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think the record should show that all of this testimony has been
taken upstairs with the court reporter present in front of the actual microfilm
machine itself; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, let us adjourn to your office and continue the taking of this
testimony, please.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, the following proceedings were had at the office where the deposition
originally commenced.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, I'm going to mark what has FBI Exhibit D-77 on
it as Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 6, being the container with your initials
and the microfilm record itself, which you placed on the microfilm reader and
about which you have just testified upstairs.</p>

<p>Now, I'm going to hand you what has been marked as Waldman Deposition
Exhibit No. 7 and ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is a copy made from our microfilm reader-printer of
an order received by Klein's from a Mr. A. Hidell, Post Office Box No. 2915, in
Dallas, Tex. I want to clarify that this is not the order, itself, received from
Mr. Hidell, but it's a form created by us internally from an order received from
Mr. Hidell on a small coupon taken from an advertisement of ours in a magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 7 is a print from the microfilm
negative which we just viewed upstairs; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 8 is also a print from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
microfilm record we viewed upstairs showing the actual coupon and the envelope
in which the coupon was enclosed; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And do you have any general advertising program whereby you
advertise in gun magazines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. We do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Can you just give us one or more of the magazines in which this
coupon might have been taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Well, this coupon was specifically taken from American Rifleman
Magazine, issue of February 1963. It's identified by the department number
which is shown as&mdash;now, if I can read this&mdash;shown as Department 358 on
the coupon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that number also appears in the address on the envelope to
you, is that correct, or to your company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I believe that you said the total amount was $19.95, plus
$1.50 for shipping charges, or $21.45; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The $1.50 is for both shipping charges and handling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you what has been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 788,
which appears to be a U.S. postal money order payable to the order of Klein's
Sporting Goods, and marked that it's from a purchaser named A. Hidell, and
as the purchaser's street address is Post Office Box No. 2915, and the purchaser's
City, Dallas, Tex.; March 12, 1963: and underneath the amount of $21.45, the
number 2,202,130,462. And on the reverse side there appears to be an endorsement
of a bank.</p>

<p>I wonder if you would read that endorsement, if you would, and examine it,
please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is a stamped endorsement reading "Pay to the order of
the First National Bank of Chicago," followed by our account No. 50 space 91144,
and that, in turn, followed by "Klein's Sporting Goods, Inc."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not that is your company's endorsement
on that money order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It's identical to our endorsement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And I hand you what has been marked as Waldman Deposition
Exhibit No. 9 and ask you if you can state what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is our endorsement stamp which reads the same as that
shown on the money order in question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have just now stamped Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 9
with your endorsement stamp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any way of knowing when exactly this money order
was deposited by your company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. I cannot specifically say when this money order was deposited
by our company; however, as previously stated, a money order for $21.45 passed
through our cash register on March 13, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You're reading from <span class="locked">Waldman&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. From a Mr. A. Hidell of Post Office Box No. 2915, from
Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you are now reading from Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. As indicated on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 7. Now, we
cannot specifically say when this money order was deposited, but on our deposit
of March 13, 1963, we show an item of $21.45, as indicated on the Xerox copy
of our deposit slip marked, or identified by&mdash;as Waldman Deposition Exhibit
No. 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And I have just marked as a document what you are reading
from, which appears to be a deposit with the First National Bank of Chicago
by your company; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And on that deposit, one of the items is $21.45, out of a total
deposit that day of $13,827.98; is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when we examined Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 1, you
had a control number of which the last four numbers were T749, and when
you shipped the rifle, you had the control number with the last four numbers as
T750; otherwise the control number is the same. Could you tell us what accounts
for the difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; these numbers that you referred to are not control numbers,
as previously stated. These are known as catalog numbers. The number
C20-T749 describes a rifle only, whereas the catalog No. C20-T750 describes the
Italian carbine rifle with a four-power scope, which is sold as a package unit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what the rifle would have cost without the scope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. As I recall, it was either $12.78 or $12.95.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would the advertisement run in the Rifleman's Magazine of February
1963, have given the purchaser the option to buy with or without the scope,
if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Without specific reference to the ad, I would say that it did.
Most usually we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And the purchaser would signify his preference in what manner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The customer designates whether he wants the rifle only or
whether he wants the rifle with the scope by his selection of catalog numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When this rifle came to your company, was the scope already
mounted on it when you got it from Crescent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who put the scope on the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The scope was mounted on the rifle in our gun shop, most
probably by a gunsmith named William Sharp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would Mr. Sharp drill whatever holes were necessary for the
mounting and do the actual mounting then himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would Mr. Sharp or anyone else in your company in any way
sight in the sight, whether it would be boresighting or actual firing with the
sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. No; it's very unlikely in an inexpensive rife of this sort that
he would do anything other than roughly aline the scope with the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any records which show where you purchased the
scope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It's reasonably certain the scope was purchased from Martin B.
Retting, Inc., 1129 Washington Boulevard. Culver City, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it have any identification on the scope itself, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It's most probable it carried the name "Ordnance Optics."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mr. Waldman, perhaps we'd better further identify the
microfilm which show your control numbers. We marked the microfilm as
Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 6. Do you have any control numbers on this
at all which indicate which microfilm this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. This is our film No. 38, which covers our transactions Nos.
269688 through 270596.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And I believe that you already testified to the control number or
transaction number that appears on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 7 as being
number what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. 270502.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, referring to Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 3,
which are the serial numbers of the 100 rifles which were made in this shipment
from Crescent Firearms to you, and Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 5,
which is the invoice from Crescent Firearms which has stamped on it that it
was paid by your company on March 4, is there any way to verify that this
payment pertained to rifles which are shown on Waldman Deposition Exhibit
No. 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. The forms submitted by Crescent Firearms showing serial
numbers of rifles included in the shipment covered by their invoice No. 3178
indicate that the rifle carrying serial No. C-2766 was included in that shipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, those <span class="locked">forms&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Those forms are your exhibit captioned Waldman Deposition
Exhibit No. 3. Now, our payment voucher No. 28966 of March 1, 1963, which
is your Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 5 shows in the lower portion, second
column from the left, the number 3178, which ties in with Crescent Firearms
invoice No. 3178.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you have before you a carbon copy of a check that was written
by your company to Crescent Firearms in the amount of $850, and attached to
it, the attachment that shows it's for invoice No. 3178?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, do your records show whether or not the rifle was
shipped with the scope mounted on it or is there any way that you know whether
or not it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Our catalog No. C20-T750, which was the number indicated
on the coupon prepared by A. Hidell, designates a rifle with scope attached.
And we would have so shipped it unless the customer specifically specified that
he did not wish to have it attached. There is nothing in our records to indicate
that there was any request made by the customer, and therefore we would
have every reason to believe that it was shipped as a rifle with scope mounted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not the rifle would have been broken
down in shipment or whether or not it would have been shipped fully
assembled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It was customary for us to ship all of these rifles and scopes
fully assembled, and I would have no reason to believe that this particular one
would have been shipped otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And do you know in what kind of a container it would have been
shipped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It was customary for us to ship these rifles with scopes attached
in a corrugated cardboard carton made for us by the Rudd Container
Corporation of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how long would that carton be in size, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Approximately 60 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever furnish any samples of this carton or any wrapping
paper or tape to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Yes; we did furnish a sample of the carton together with the
type of sealing tape that was generally used and such craft paper that may
have been used for inner cushioning packing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, when we testified upstairs in front of the microfilm
machine, was the microfilm itself more clear or less clear than the photostats or
prints that have been made from it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. More clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So it would be possible to read items on the microfilm itself that
might not come out clear on the printed copies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Waldman, the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy appreciates all the cooperation which your company, and
in particular you, have given to this situation. And we know that it's not a
happy situation to you, and that the gun could have been purchased anywhere.
As it happens, this particular gun was purchased with your company, and we
want to thank you very much for your cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to see the deposition before you sign it? Mr. Waldman,
you have the right to read the deposition and sign it before anything further
is done with it, or you can waive the signing of it, whatever you like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waldman</span>. It would be well for me to read this because of the possibility
of a transposition of numbers or other errors in the recording.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. (To reporter.) Perhaps you can keep the original copy
here, if you would, and give it to Mr. Waldman and mail the other copies directly
to us in Washington, and then could you make whatever corrections there are
and send it directly to us in Washington, and I'll give you my name if you
would mail it to my attention.</p>

<h2 id="t370">TESTIMONY OF MITCHELL J. SCIBOR</h2>

<p>The testimony of Mitchell J. Scibor was taken on May 20, 1964, at 4540 West
Madison Street, Chicago, Ill., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mitchell J. Scibor, called as a witness herein, having been first duly sworn,
was examined and testified as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you please state your name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Mitchell J. Scibor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. 2942 North Sayre Avenue, Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Employed by Klein's Sporting Goods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. General operating manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you so employed on or about November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you at any time on that date contacted by any law enforcement
agency with regard to a particular rifle, Serial No. C-2766?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And could you tell us the circumstances surrounding this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. I got a call Friday evening, November 22, asking if it would be
possible to get at the records&mdash;at our records to see if that gun had been in our
possession or sold by us. I got permission from one of the executives to open
the store and view our records, and I came down here somewhere between
10 and 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what did you do when you got down here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. We went in with the Government men and&mdash;just before we went
in, Mr. Waldman came down and we came in and he took over as far as getting&mdash;trying
to find the information that we needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you try to find that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. By looking in our microfilm records of sales of merchandise for
that particular gun.</p>

<p>The FBI furnished us with information stating that we had received the
gun from Crescent Firearms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, did you look at the microfilms of your purchasers or your
sales or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes; we used two machines and looked at the microfilms of our
sales until we had found that particular gun with the serial number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were upstairs when Mr. Waldman was looking at the microfilm
of which a printed copy is Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 7; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 7, there is a Serial No.
C-2766?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this serial number on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 7 the
first contact you had on Friday evening that led you to believe that you had
shipped this particular rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you discover or find out this information, if you know&mdash;strike
the question.</p>

<p>I believe you said you got down here about 10 o'clock that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Between 10 and 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you started going through your microfilm records?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when did you actually find the microfilm of which Waldman
Deposition Exhibit No. 7 is a print?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. About 4 o'clock in the morning, as far as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then turned this information over to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Mr. Waldman did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I'm going to hand you what has been marked as Waldman
Deposition Exhibit No. 4 and ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes; it's a copy of our receiving record which we use to identify
firearms or guns by assigning a weapon a particular booking number or control
number along with the serial number so at a future date we can identify that
particular gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever seen Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 7 before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice the date and the notations in the upper left-hand corner,
RR-1243; underneath that, the date 2-22-63. Do you know what that has
reference to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes; the "RR" stands for receiving record No. 1243, and that
merchandise was booked or actually received by our receiving department on
2-22-63.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does it show from whom it was received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes; Crescent Firearms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And underneath the "Crescent Firearms," what does it say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Italian Carcano T38. 6.5 Italian caliber rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, there are some notations in the upper right-hand corner, what
does that have reference to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Those are notations strictly for the receiving department. I
have the men back there keep these in rotation so that I can always fill&mdash;in the
same rotation as they come out of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And did you do any of that writing at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not these serial numbers are
assigned by people under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Repeat that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, do you have any supervision or control over the people
making the entries on the serial numbers and your control numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I don't believe we went into your background, general background.
You might state where you were born and what educational background you
have, for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. I was born in Chicago, November 27, 1920. I finished 4 years of
high school, 6½ years in the Marine Corps, and Klein's Sporting Goods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You're married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. I have been with Klein's for 18 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been with Klein's for <span class="locked">18&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Approximately 18 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you're married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Married and two children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 4 filed customarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. That is filed in a desk drawer back in the receiving department,
which I designated that those should be filed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any master control ledger or book of any kind that
has these control numbers on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes. One copy is sent to what we call the booking department,
and those are put into a master book, control book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you required by law to keep records of serial numbers of guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And do you find on Waldman Deposition Exhibit No. 4 your
control number for a rifle with the serial number C-2766?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your control number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. VC-836.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How are these serial numbers obtained for placement on Waldman
Deposition Exhibit No. 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Directly off the guns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does someone actually look at the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scibor</span>. Yes; someone looks; visually they are taken off the guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We want to thank you very much, sir, for your cooperation in
helping obtaining this information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. From 1225 South Grand Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you employed, self-employed, or do you work for some company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. I work for the George Rose &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What business is the George Rose &amp; Co. engaged in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. You work for Merchanteers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Oh, pardon me; Merchanteers, Inc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your immediate employer is Merchanteers, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Merchanteers, Inc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that associated with the George Rose &amp; Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In what business is Merchanteers, Inc., engaged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Merchanteers, Inc. has mail <span class="locked">order&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Mail order and management.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. And management.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And does it do work for George Rose &amp; Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Do I work for George Rose &amp; Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, Merchanteers, Inc.&mdash;it is the mail order agency for George
Rose &amp; Co., is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. No; may I clarify it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; well, I better have him, and then I may ask you to clarify it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Yes; all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what you know of the relationship between George Rose &amp;
Co. and Merchanteers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Well, Merchanteers. Inc. is a mail-order business. But, it is
also a management company and makes out the paychecks for employees from the
George Rose &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. Now, what business is George Rose &amp; Co. engaged in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. George Rose &amp; Co. are wholesalers and sell to retail stores.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do they sell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Musical instruments, cutlery, firearms, watches, clocks, and
various others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does George Rose &amp; Co. engage in any mail-order business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yeah; we get mail orders, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You take mail orders as George Rose &amp; Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. Wholesale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At wholesale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Wholesale, yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, there is also a company called Seaport Traders, isn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Seaport Traders is another mail-order business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is another mail-order business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you work for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Only in a supervisory position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the company that you work for. Merchanteers, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Merchanteers; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it Merchanteers, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Merchanteers, Inc.; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They manage the business of Seaport Traders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, last fall did the Federal Bureau of Investigation visit your
place of business and inquire as to the sale of a certain Smith &amp; Wesson
revolver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. I believe it was November the 30th, a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in searching your records for any such sale, to what particular
record did you first look?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. We started first, after having received the serial number,
through our serial number book for this particular type of gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what serial number did the FBI give you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. V, as in victory, 510210-65248.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, those two numbers signify what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. The first number, V510210, is commonly described as the butt
number, while the second number, 65248, usually is described as the crane number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the serial numbers are stamped where on the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. As mentioned before, the first number is on the butt of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. And also it appears on the lower part of the barrel.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it appears also on the outside rim of the cylinder of the gun.
In other words, the first number, 510210, appears three times on the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that is usually known as the serial number of the gun; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes. But, we are&mdash;it is required that since Smith &amp; Wesson
revolvers carry two kinds of serial numbers, also to list the so-called crane
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that also known as the assembly number, the crane number?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. I am not familiar with the word assembly number, but it
might be possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the meaning of the word crane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. The crane is when you flip off the cylinder, inside is a crane
and there is a number on the stem, which is the second number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you maintain a record of all sales of guns in a book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes; in this book here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have the book before you, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is a black, looseleaf notebook; looseleaf notebook with a black
cover. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you keep that in handwriting, or by typewriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you keep a typewritten or handwritten record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Handwritten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When the agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation called
on you on Saturday, November 30, 1963, you looked to your book that carries
a record in handwriting of your sales?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you find this record of this particular gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I hand you here a document which is identified as FBI Laboratory
No. D-191, being a photostat. Do you recognize this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you compare that with the page in your notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. It is the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that is identified in your notebook as Case No. 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Case No. 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the significance of the words "Case No. 3"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. It is a listing of a case which we received.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of a case, a particular case, of guns; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It also has a 99 enclosed in a circle. What is the significance of
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. I presume that is the contents, the piece contents of the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You found, therefore, a record in your notebook, and that would
indicate what? That you had sold the gun at some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I would like to offer and have marked this photostat of a
page of the looseleaf notebook, which is identified as Case No. 3, as Exhibit No. 1
to this deposition of Mr. Michaelis.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the document last referred to hereinabove was marked to the
Michaelis deposition as Commission Exhibit No. 1 for identification by the notary
public.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, from that looseleaf notebook were you able to determine from
what source you bought the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me now where you bought the gun and when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And from whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you have before you now a file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And does it refer to this particular purchase of 99 guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. No. We bought altogether 500 guns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 500? And what is the file, the title, that you are now showing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Empire Wholesale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Now, tell me what you found as to the source of this
gun; where you bought it and from whom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. We bought it from Empire Wholesale Sporting Goods, Ltd.,
360 Craig Street West, Montreal 1, Quebec.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what date did you buy it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Invoice No. 1181 dated October 13, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it was shipped to you by the Empire Wholesale Sporting Goods,
Ltd., on what date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. It went&mdash;it was on 10/19/62, in St. Albans, Vt., and from
then on it was directed to our place of business, which was at that time 1225
South Grand Avenue. However, the merchandise in question did not arrive
before January 3, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the date it did arrive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes. It was received January 3, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion held off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when this gun was first received, what was the length of its
barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Five inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And was it changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. It was changed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. To a 2¼-inch barrel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Well, we gave the guns out to Mr. L.&nbsp;M. Johnson and instructed
him to make up the guns as far as barrel lengths are concerned to our
specifications.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you shorten them from 5 to 2¼ inches? Explain to me
for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Because we have quite frequently calls for the Smith &amp; Wesson
revolvers with shorter barrels such as 2¼ inch or 4 inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you shorten all of the consignment that you received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just a certain number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this particular gun was shortened, then, from 5 to 2¼?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Johnson's number&mdash;and is that M.&nbsp;L. Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes; just a minute. Or L.&nbsp;M. It is M. L.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is his address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. At that time, 13440 Burbank Boulevard, Van Nuys, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, that gun was sold, was it not, pursuant to a mail order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes; mail order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I hand you a document which has been marked Commission Exhibit
No. 135. Will you examine that and tell me whether or not you ever
saw that before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. I saw it the first time on November the 30th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The first time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you find that? Where was it when you saw it
on November 30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. It was attached to our invoice No. 5371, in the records, the
red copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this particular mail order, did you have anything to do with
filling that order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your position here? Do you have charge of the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. I am manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are manager of the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And all of these records are under your control, are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Well, not particularly at that time because my actual supervision
of the Seaport Traders, Inc., activities started later during the year. I
mean in September and October, when the girl in charge left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At least in November you were in charge and in possession of
all of the records of the Seaport Traders?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have no personal knowledge, then, of the transaction by which
the gun was shipped and sold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Not prior to the first investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you are providing me with records which were under your
control as of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes; correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, can you tell me who would have actually received the mail
order through the mail and who would have filled the order and shipped it?
Do you know what person would have done this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. There are various operations. The order was received <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. I probably would have opened it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes; Mr. Rose usually opens the mail and distributes the
mail. This particular order would have gone to the person in charge at that
time of the Seaport Traders, who was Emma Vaughn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Emma Vaughn, V-a-u-g-h-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what would have happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. She would have processed the order in writing up invoice No.
5371. After 1 week she gave out the order to the order filler and packer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. This is a title, order filler and packer. She is one person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that last word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Packer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Packer. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. And the order was shipped on March the 20th, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have been testifying from a record which you have before you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that is a paper which has been marked for identification by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation DL-28, Seaport Traders, Inc., No. A-5371.</p>

<p>Is that correct? You have been testifying from information contained on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was in your records, was it, as of November 30, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you tell me, describe that document and tell me its significance
in your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. This particular document is, after the order is processed, filed
in our records under the name of the respective customer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean after the revolver that was ordered by this mail order
coupon, 135, has been packed and shipped, this invoice A-5371, is filed as a
permanent record, is it, of the shipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct; filed under the name of the respective customer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this shows the words A.&nbsp;J. Hidell, P.0. Box 2915, Dallas, Tex.
This appears on this invoice A-5371, does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is described as an S. &amp; W. .38 special, 2-inch Commando. What is
the meaning of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Two inch is the barrel length. Commando is a description
which we more or less gave because we have another 2-inch gun at a higher price
and, in order that the order filler is able to identify between the two types, we
have this type described as Commando.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the No. 510210. What is the significance of that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. It is the serial number of the gun in question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it shows deposit, $10. Balance c.o.d., $19.95. What is the
significance of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. We received, together with the order, the amount of $10 in
cash. Since the sales price is $29.95, the merchandise was shipped with a c.o.d.
for the balance of $19.95.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does this invoice show the date it was shipped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. March 20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does it also show which one of your companies shipped it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. The Seaport Traders, Inc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have this document marked, Invoice No. A-5371,
as the Exhibit No. 2 to the deposition of Mr. Michaelis.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the document last referred to hereinabove was marked to the
Michaelis deposition as Commission Exhibit No. 2 for identification by the notary
public.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now I also show you a white copy of invoice No. A-5371 which has
been marked on the face as DL-27. Can you tell me what that document is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. This document is the first copy of the invoice No. 5371 which
is kept in the office as permanent record and is filed in the numerical order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me what your business custom was in March of 1963
with reference to the preparing of invoices, original invoice and copies, and
shipping an item which had been ordered by mail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. The order received by mail is written up and invoiced in
quadruplicate on a snap-out form. The first white copy remains in the office
and is filed on a numerical order.</p>

<p>The second copy is used as a packing slip whereby the upper part of the
invoice is torn off and used as a shipping label and the lower part used as a
packing slip.</p>

<p>The third copy is filed permanently in the office under the name of the
respective customer after the order has been shipped.</p>

<p>The fourth copy is the acknowledgment of the order copy and lists on the
back side a statement which has to be signed by the respective customer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. A statement to the effect, I believe that it said that the buyer
states that he is a citizen of the United States, and that he has never been convicted
in any court of the United States, territories, possessions, et cetera. Do
you want <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, now, this fourth copy that has on the back this statement by
the customer, is that mailed to the customer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. It is mailed to the customer, but not in this particular case.
Indicated on the invoice are three X's, which indicates that we have already
a statement to this effect on file because this particular mail order coupon has
already the statement, and the name of the witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the particular mail-order coupon that you refer to is Commission
No. 135, and it has on it the statement required together with the
witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. With the witness; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that witness' name is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Well, I identify it as D-r-i-t-t-a-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's right. You are right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then in this instance the fourth copy did not go to the purchaser?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Did not go to the purchaser; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the first copy is in white and is the one which you have
identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And we will mark that as Exhibit 3.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the document last referred to hereinabove was marked to the
Michaelis deposition as Commission Exhibit No. 3 for identification by the
notary public.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The second copy is in red, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. The second copy is in yellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yellow. That is the packing slip copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The third copy is in red?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that is the one you have identified as Exhibit 2, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in this instance the fourth copy was not used, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Exhibits 2 and 3 were also found as a part of your original
records when you investigated, or looked through your records at the request of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation on November 30, 1963. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you another document here which is a slip of red
paper marked "Railway Express Agency" which has been heretofore identified
with an FBI Exhibit No. DL-29. What is that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Just a minute. I have to get the original. Now, this exhibit
<span class="locked">number&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is given a No. DL-29. Will you describe it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes; that is a copy of the receipt which we got from the
Railway Express Agency showing that on March 20, 1963, one carton with a
pistol was shipped to A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Tex. It shows, furthermore,
that Railway Express is instructed to collect a c.o.d. fee of $19.95. And
it shows furthermore the number of the original receipt, which is 70638.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Number of original receipt? Which receipt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Of the Railway Express receipt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is this it here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Original receipt, Railway Express receipt, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does it identify the invoice in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Except by name, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Except by name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And does it describe the article shipped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Only in broad terms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. One carton consisting of a pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One carton, pistol. I see. I would like to have this marked as
Exhibit 4, being the pink copy of a Railway Express receipt.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the document last referred to hereinabove was marked to the
Michaelis deposition as Commission Exhibit No. 4 for identification by the notary
public.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, a document identified as No. DL-30 by the Bureau of Investigation,
receipt No. 70638. Will you describe that for me, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. This document is required in addition by the Railway Express
Agency for all c.o.d. shipments, and indicates again the name of the consignee,
his address, and lists our invoice number which is, in this case, No. 5371. It
directs the Railway Express Agency to remit the amount to be collected to Seaport
Traders, Inc. The amount of the c.o.d. is $19.95, and the service charge
has to be collected from the consignee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have that marked as Exhibit 5.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the document last referred to hereinabove was marked to the
Michaelis deposition as Commission Exhibit No. 5 for identification by the notary
public.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Exhibit 4 has been described as a Railway Express Agency
receipt. Exhibit 5, which is an additional document entitled "A brief of information
for c.o.d. shipment, Railway Express Agency," those were in your
files when you searched for information regarding the sale of this pistol as of
November 30, 1963. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there anything in your files which shows that the Railway Express
did remit to you the $19.95?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. The fact that the exhibit number&mdash;may I see this green one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Was attached to the red copy of the invoice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Red copy of the invoice <span class="locked">being&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. No; was attached to the red copy of the invoice, exhibit
<span class="locked">number&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Indicates that the money was received.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. Now, these documents were delivered to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation by you, were they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Through Mr. Wood; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And these documents, Exhibits 2 to 5, inclusive, are original documents,
are they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Exhibit 1 being a photostat of the page in your looseleaf notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which carries the record of the sale, record of the item?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And does anybody in your organization that you know of have
any personal knowledge of packing this particular gun and shipping it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. I doubt very much that the packer would remember this particular
parcel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About how many guns of this type do you sell and ship out of here
in a year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. In 1 year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; just a general estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. For Seaport Traders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span>. That type of gun&mdash;we sell more .22's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, about how many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. Seaport Traders, I would say that&mdash;this is a rough guess,
Mr. Ball. This particular type, that Seaport Traders might have sold maybe
120 in a year; 120, 150 in a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would that be sold through mail order, or both mail <span class="locked">order&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. I am talking about particularly mail-order business from
Seaport Traders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 120 or 125?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. 120, 150, of this particular type of gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there anything else that you know about this particular transaction
that you would like to tell me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Michaelis</span>. No, sir; I believe I answered all the questions of this transaction.</p>

<p>The testimony of Roy S. Truly was taken at 2:30 p.m., on May 14, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Mr. Truly, this is a continuation of your deposition. I took
the last one and you have been sworn and I don't know that it is exactly
necessary for you to take the oath again, since this is a continuation of the
deposition. I took the last one, didn't I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Oh, no; I gave a statement that was under oath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oh, no; this is a deposition. You appeared before the Commission&mdash;that's
right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Mr. Belin took my sworn deposition also about a week before
I went up there when you both were in Dallas and he also took a recorded
deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; that was just an investigation, an inquiry. We didn't
record that. You weren't under oath then. Will you stand up and be sworn?
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before this
Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Roy S. Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you are superintendent of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that your title?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. And a director of the Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have been employed by the Depository for a number of years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Since 1934; since 1934.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You testified before the Commission in Washington, you say, on
the 24th of March 1964; did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your testimony is filed in volume 28, I believe, of the Commission
here. There are certain matters which have come to the attention of the Commission
since then that I would like to inquire about, and that's the reason we
are taking your deposition, which will be in addition to the testimony you have
already given.</p>

<p>Do you recall anytime that you saw any guns in the Texas School Book
Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; I saw two guns on November 20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whose guns were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. They belonged to Mr. Warren Caster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, before inquiring into the circumstances of seeing two guns
that belonged to Mr. Warren Caster on November 20, 1963, I'll ask you whether
or not you ever at anytime before that time or after that time saw guns in the
Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Never before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Never before, and between that date Wednesday, November 20, and
Friday, November 22, did you ever see any guns in the Texas School Book
Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I did see guns in there after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is, you saw guns of police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Of the police officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Carried by police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; and I saw a rifle being carried from the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, a rifle was found on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw that in place on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I only saw the rifle as they were going out the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before the assassination, was there any other occasion besides the
one we are inquiring about, when you saw guns in the Texas School Book
Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 20, 1963, you saw two guns owned by Mr. Warren
Caster, can you tell me where and when and the circumstances under which
you saw these guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It was during the lunch period or right at the end of the lunch
period on November 20. Mr. Caster came in the door from the first floor and
spoke to me and showed me two rifles that he had just purchased. I looked
at these and picked up the larger one of the two and examined it and handed
it back to Mr. Caster, with the remark that it was really a handsome rifle or
words to that effect, at which time Mr. Caster explained to me that he had
bought himself a rifle to go deer hunting with, and he hadn't had one and he
had been intending to buy one for a long time, and that he had also bought a
.22 rifle for his boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you handle the .22 rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did see it, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I did see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it out of the carton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The carton was open, I believe, and I saw it. I don't recall picking
it up or taking it out of the carton, but I could see it lying in the bottom
part of the carton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you did take the large rifle out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. And raised it to my shoulder and go through the motion of sighting
it, but not cocking it&mdash;just looking at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who else was there besides you and Mr. Caster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, the only person I can recall being there was Mr. Shelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is his position with the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He is manager of the miscellaneous department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was this in the open warehouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; right at the front. Mr. Caster had placed the cartons on
the counter near the front door and that's where the rifles were when I saw
them, and I picked one up out of the cartons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were they employees of the Texas School Book Depository
company on the first floor at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; they were&mdash;as I recall the time&mdash;that the boys had probably
gone back to work and could have been walking around before they went
in the shipping department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would have been about what time of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I'd say around 1 o'clock&mdash;very close to it. It could have been
a little after or a little before. The boys go back to lunch at 12:45, so there
I'm not too clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened to these two rifles, Mr. Truly, that Mr. Caster
got during the noon hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. They were placed back in the carton and Mr. Caster carried them
out of the lobby door with him. That's the last I saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see them again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Never&mdash;never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see from that day until Friday, November 22, did
you ever see those guns in the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you recall that in your testimony before the Commission you
told them that at some time after the shooting, you advised Captain Fritz of the
name of Lee Oswald and his address in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in order to place the time of it, was it before or after the
rifle had been found on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I wouldn't know. I think it must have been around the time the
rifle was found, because I was not on the sixth floor at that time, but when I
told&mdash;let's go back a few minutes&mdash;pardon me&mdash;I told Chief Lumpkin a good
many minutes after we came down from the roof and he went ahead and gave
some orders to two or three policemen surrounding him and then said, "Let's go
up and tell Captain Fritz."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what did you tell Chief Lumpkin when you came down from
the roof of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. When I noticed this boy was missing, I told Chief Lumpkin that,
"We have a man here that's missing." I said, "It may not mean anything, but
he isn't here." I first called down to the other warehouse and had Mr. Akin pull
the application of the boy so I could get&mdash;quickly get his address in Irving and
his general description, so I could be more accurate than I would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he the only man missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The only one I noticed at that time. Now, I think there was one
or two more, possibly Charles Givens, but I had seen him out in front walking
up the street just before the firing of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But walking which way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The last time I saw him, he was walking across Houston Street,
east on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make a check of your employees afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, no; not complete. No, I just saw the group of the employees
over there on the floor and I noticed this boy wasn't with them. With no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
thought in my mind except that I had seen him a short time before in the building,
I noticed he wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean "a short time before"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I would say 10 or 12 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean that's when you saw him in the lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. In the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you noticed he wasn't over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, I asked Bill Shelley if he had seen him around and he said
No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you told Chief Lumpkin that there was a man missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; and he said, "Let's go tell Captain Fritz." Well, I didn't
know where Captain Fritz was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you tell Chief Lumpkin the man was missing before or
after you called to the warehouse and got the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, I called the warehouse beforehand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't talk to any police officer before you called the warehouse
and got the address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did that on your own without instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So, when you talked to Chief Lumpkin, you at that time had in
your possession there the address of Lee Oswald in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right, I had scribbled it down on a piece of map or something
so I would remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the address that he had put on his application form for
employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you know of any other address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I didn't know of any other address at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I supposed that's where he was living.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was Captain Fritz when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He was on the sixth floor in the area where they found the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And was the rifle there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, I never saw the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was this after or before the rifle had been taken from the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It was before the rifle had been taken from the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you know whether it was before or after the rifle was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Apparently the rifle had been found before I got to the sixth floor,
but just how early, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you had heard that the rifle was found, had you, by your talk
with Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I learned it was found while I was on the
sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. While you were on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. While I was on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you went with Chief Lumpkin to the sixth floor,
didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was your purpose of going there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. My purpose in going there was to inform Captain Fritz that this
boy was missing and give him his telephone number, and his Irving address,
at the suggestion of Chief Lumpkin, who accompanied me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you give Captain Fritz this name and address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it while you were there that you learned the rifle had been
found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't remember who I learned this <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I didn't ask you that, I'm talking about time only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That was while I was on the sixth floor is when I learned the
rifle was found, but I did not see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Now, was it before or after you told Captain Fritz the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
name and address of Lee Oswald, that you learned that the rifle was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I can't remember, I believe it was afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are sure it was after you told Captain Fritz&mdash;after what, you
tell me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I told&mdash;well, when Chief Lumpkin and I went to the sixth floor,
Captain Fritz was standing in the area where I later learned they had found
the gun, and Chief Lumpkin told Captain Fritz that Mr. Truly had something
to tell him, which I would like to tell him, so he stepped over 4 or 5 feet to
where I was, away from the other men&mdash;officers and reporters, I would say,
that were on the floor, and I repeated the words to Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I told him that we had a man missing&mdash;I told him what his name
was and his Irving address and he said, "All right, thank you, Mr. Truly. We
will get right on it," or words to that effect, and so I left the sixth floor shortly.</p>

<p>While I was up there, just as I left Captain Fritz, a reporter walked over
and said, "What about this fellow Oswald?" And I said, "Where did you learn
the name 'Oswald'?" Because I had talked rather low to Captain Fritz and
I said, "He's just an employee here," and I left, and sometime&mdash;someone informed
me that they had found the gun. I don't know who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It was along about that time, as near as I can remember, and I
went back down to the first floor and I don't think I was up on the sixth floor
any other time that day. I possibly could have been, but I don't recall it, because
I was besieged by reporters and everybody else on the first floor, and
talking to officers and so forth and I had no occasion to go back up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, about what time of day would you say is your best estimate
that you told Captain Fritz of the name "Lee Oswald" and his address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. My best estimate would be a little before 1 o'clock&mdash;10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The gun wasn't found until after 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It wasn't found until after 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, it wasn't found until after 1 o'clock. I won't tell you exactly
the time the gun was found, but I will say that the gun was not found until
after 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, I may be mistaken about where I learned they had found
the gun. I thought it was on the sixth floor&mdash;it could have been some other
place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Captain Fritz said you didn't tell him that until after the gun was
found and that seems to correspond with your memory too, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It sure does, because I remember clearly that Captain Fritz was
over at where the gun was found and I'm sure they must have found it or he
wouldn't have been standing in that area when we came up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, if the gun was found after 1 o'clock, when was it that you
discovered that Lee Oswald wasn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I thought it was about 20 minutes after the shooting&mdash;the assassination,
but it could have been longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you thought originally it might have been 10
minutes of 2 or so that you learned that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Ten minutes to 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ten minutes to 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It was around 1 o'clock&mdash;that period of time after I came down
from the sixth floor to the first floor was rather hazy in my memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think it might have been after 1 when you first noticed he
wasn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't think so&mdash;I don't feel like at was. It could have possibly
been so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, if the gun was not found before 1:10, if it wasn't found before
that, can you give me any estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That seems to be a longer time after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't wait 20 minutes from the time you learned Lee Oswald's
address until the time you told Captain Fritz, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I did stand there on the first floor waiting until Chief
Lumpkin got through talking for a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me about how many minutes you think it was from the time
you obtained the address of Lee Oswald until you told Captain Fritz the name
and address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I think it was immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Immediately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Immediately, after I called to the warehouse and got his name
and address in Irving, I turned around and walked over and told Captain Fritz
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Chief Lumpkin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; Chief Lumpkin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; Chief Lumpkin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. And I remember Chief Lumpkin talking to two or three officers
and I stepped back and he went ahead and told them a few things&mdash;it could
have been 2 or 3 or 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Not over that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't believe so, and then he came to me and said, "All right,
Mr. Truly, let's go up and see Captain Fritz and tell him this."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, if the gun wasn't found until after 1:10, you think it might
have been as late as 1:05 or so before you discovered that Oswald wasn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It could be&mdash;it could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have no exact memory as to the time you discovered he was
not there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I didn't believe after thinking things over&mdash;it was over in
15 or 20 minutes after the shots were fired, but after retracing my trip to the
roof and the time delay and back, I would have to say that it was farther along
in the day than I had believed, so it could have been 1 or 1:05 or something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you discovered Oswald wasn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right, and at such time that you have information of the
officers taking the names of the workers in the warehouse over in and around
the wrapping tables, it was at such time that I noticed that this boy wasn't
among the other workers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You remember you had seen him on the second floor, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's when you were with Officer Baker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you heard that Tippit had been shot, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Not after&mdash;until after I had told Chief Lumpkin and Captain
Fritz and come back down to the first floor, then I learned that he had been
shot. The first I learned of it&mdash;there was a young officer ran in the front door
and told another officer, possibly a lieutenant, that there was an officer shot in
Oak Cliff and that was all I knew at that time. I did not know that they had
captured Oswald then. Later on a newspaper reporter told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you say that you knew that Givens was not there afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I knew he wasn't there at the time of the shooting because I had
seen him walk across the street&mdash;up the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Toward what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Up Elm Street across Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Toward Main&mdash;down toward Main?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I saw him walking on the north side of Elm, crossing Houston&mdash;on
the north side of Elm crossing Houston. However, at that time I saw two
other boys with him and I later learned, I believe, that it was James Jarman
and possibly Harold Norman&mdash;there were two or three&mdash;they were all standing
in the crowd close to myself and they started across Houston Street up Elm.
I didn't see them turn over to the right across Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wait a minute&mdash;you saw Norman and Jarman with Givens in front
of the Texas School Book Depository Building first, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Right; sometime earlier&mdash;a good deal&mdash;a little while before the
shooting&mdash;I believe they were the three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Jarman and Norman going across Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I'm pretty sure there was the three of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Jarman and Norman say that they went back into the
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, apparently they did, but I saw them out there&mdash;I noticed
them there on the corner and starting across the street, but whether they completed
it&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is the last place you saw Givens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The last place I remember seeing Givens was in the middle of
the crossing, in the middle of Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Walking in which direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Walking east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Walking east on the north side of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. North side of Elm&mdash;he had not completely crossed the street&mdash;Houston
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did Givens come back to the building later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I didn't see him&mdash;later on he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When&mdash;how much later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Much later&mdash;I suppose&mdash;I don't know his actions during that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he come back to the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I can't say&mdash;I think he came back to the front of the building&mdash;I
can't answer for sure whether he came in the building&mdash;I know he was at the
police station later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all right now.</p>

<p>(The deposition of the deponent Truly was adjourned from Room 301 Federal
Building, Dallas, Tex., and continued at the office of the deponent Truly in the
Texas School Book Depository Building, 411 Elm Street, Dallas, Tex., as
follows:)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Truly, when you came into the building with Officer Baker
you tried to look up the elevator shaft, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; I sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you see the elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. On the fifth floor&mdash;both of them on the same floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were both up on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am sure, because their bottoms were level.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went up to the floor, was there an elevator on any of
the floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. When I reached the fifth floor, the east elevator was there, but
west one was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know where it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No; I don't. I didn't look, I just remember it wasn't upstairs,
so it was down below me somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took the east elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I took the east elevator load to the seventh floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Fine.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Warren Caster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. 3338 Merrell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Textbook publishing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you with some company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Yes; I am assistant manager for Southwestern Publishing Co.
with offices at 411 Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have offices in the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You rent those offices from the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. The offices are furnished in connection with our work with the
Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you tell me something about yourself, where you were born
and where you were raised and educated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Yes; I was born in New Mexico, educated in New Mexico, received
my college degrees at New Mexico Highlands University at Las Vegas,
N. Mex. I taught school in New Mexico from 1939 until I started to work with
Southwestern Publishing Co. in 1952. There was a period of about 2 years that
I spent in the U.S. Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And have you had your offices since 1952 in the Texas School Book
Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. The offices have been in the Texas School Book Depository
Building, but not in this particular building here. We have occupied three
places since I have been with the Southwestern Publishing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your office is on which floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever bring any guns into the School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. I believe it was on Wednesday, November 20, during the noon
hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whose guns were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. They were my guns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what kind of guns were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. One gun was a Remington, single-shot, .22 rifle, and the other
was a .30-06 sporterized Mauser.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who owned them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. I had just purchased them during the noon hour that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, tell us about it&mdash;what were the circumstances of the
purchase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Well, I left the Depository during the noon hour and had lunch
and, while out for the lunch hour, I stopped by Sanger-Harris sporting goods
department to look for a rifle for my son's birthday&mdash;I beg your pardon, Christmas
present&mdash;son's Christmas present, and while I was there I purchased the
single-shot .22&mdash;single shot&mdash;and at the same time was looking at some deer
rifles. I had, oh, for several years been thinking about buying a deer rifle and
they happened to have one that I liked and I purchased the .30-06 while I was
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did they box them up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. They were in cartons; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you went back to work, I guess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Yes; I picked both rifles up in cartons just like they were, this
was during the noon hour, and as I entered the Texas School Book Depository
Building on my way up to the buying office, I stopped by Mr. Truly's office, and
while I was there we examined the two rifles that I had purchased.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take them out of the carton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was there besides you and Mr. Truly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Well, I'm not really sure who was there. I think you were there,
Bill, and Mr. Shelley was there&mdash;and Mr. Roy Truly. The only people that I
know about, in any event, were there; there were workers there at the time, but
I'm not quite sure how many. I couldn't even tell you their names. I don't know
the Texas School Book Depository workers there in the shipping department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In that office, though, Truly's office, how many were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. We weren't in Mr. Truly's immediate office, we were just there
over the counter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the warehouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. We were there in the hall&mdash;just right there over the counter in
front of the warehouse; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you take the guns out of the carton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Yes; I did. They were removed from the carton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you handle them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody else handle the guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Mr. Truly handled them and I'm not sure whether Mr. Shelley
had the guns in his hands or not; I'm not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long a time were you there with the guns, and by time, just
estimate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. Well, it couldn't have been more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with the guns after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. I put them back in the carton and carried them up to my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do with them after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. I left at the end of the working day, oh, around 4 o'clock and took
the guns in the cartons and carried them and put them in my car and carried
them home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever have them back in the Texas School Book Depository
Building thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. They have never been back to the Texas School Book Depository
Building since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were those guns on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. The guns were in my home, 3338 Merrell Road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all. This will be written up and you will be asked
to come in and it will be submitted to you for signature and you can correct it
if you wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. That's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any corrections you make, make them in pen and ink and initial it
and sign it. I want to thank you very much for giving this testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Caster</span>. I thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t388">TESTIMONY OF EDDIE PIPER</h2>

<p>The testimony of Eddie Piper was taken at 4 p.m., on May 14, 1964, at the Texas
School Book Depository Building, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You understand since this is a continuation of your deposition you
are under oath still?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Thank you; I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your deposition has been taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I'm going to just ask you a few questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Sure, that's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told us that after the shooting you came out onto the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the first people that you saw on the floor after the shooting
was who?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Mr. Truly and some fellow&mdash;I really don't know who it was; like
I say, it was some fellow that was with Mr. Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Some fellow; how was he dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Oh, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he an officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes; I believe he was an officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes; a police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have a white helmet on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No; I don't think so. I didn't pay any attention to it. I was already
excited over the shooting or something when he came running into the
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did Truly and this&mdash;some fellow do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Well, Mr. Truly and this fellow run up the steps. He just hollered
for the elevator and I said, "I don't know where it is at," and I'm still standing
over there by that table and he ran up&mdash;on up the steps with this police officer&mdash;him
and another fellow and I was standing there and the people began swarming
out and around&mdash;different ones coming in, but it was where nobody could come
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were the first ones to go up the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had anybody come down the steps before they went up the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They weren't the first ones to come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes; and when the elevators come down&mdash;I really don't know who
brought the elevators down, but I know nobody ever come down the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see Vicki Adams come down the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I don't know about that, if she said she did, it was after
I got over here and walked over to the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Vicki Adams come down before Truly and the man went up
the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir, no, sir; she didn't do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you at anytime after the shooting miss Lee Oswald&mdash;did you
notice he wasn't around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I didn't notice it until the lineup. You know, I just figured
all the people was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did notice it at the lineup, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I did notice it in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean by the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I mean, when they lined us all up and told us to give our name and
address and just to go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say "they"; who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. The detective&mdash;whoever it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes; they had the building all surrounded. They went to locking
the doors back and front and told us to all come up and then go home, and I told
him, I says, "I've got to go down in the basement and get my clothes," and he
said, "You can go down and get your clothes and come on back up here, but give
me your identification and your name and tell us where you are staying," and
everybody heard me say that, I guess, and he let us out of the building, one by
one, and I went on out the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say something to anybody about not seeing Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I didn't say it, but I just saw he wasn't in the lineup&mdash;I
didn't tell anyone because I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just tell us what did you notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I noticed he was not in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You noticed that he was not in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you didn't mention it to anybody?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I didn't mention it but I knows he wasn't in the lineup,
and Charles&mdash;I don't know whether he was, but he went out for lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Charles Givens there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I couldn't remember seeing him. He went out for lunch and I don't
remember whether he come out from the building again or not because I was getting
dressed to get out of there myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Shelley, you have been sworn and this will be a continuation
of your deposition. You are still under oath, you understand that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recall seeing a couple of guns in the Texas School Book
Depository Building on the 20th of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Just outside Mr. Truly's office on the will-call counter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how did they get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Mr. Warren Caster had just purchased them and brought them
in and stopped by to see us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you handle the guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I held the .22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And was there another make of gun too&mdash;there was, wasn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; I believe there was a .30-06 Mauser that had been converted.
It was a foreign make converted to a .30-06</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you handle that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened to the guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, we looked them over, like you do any new toy, and he
puts them back in the box and goes out of the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you ever see them again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see any guns in that building between that date and
the time the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, the day the President was shot, when is the
last time you saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It was 10 or 15 minutes before 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. On the first floor over near the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. At the police station when they brought him in.</p>

building?</p>

home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go over to the southeast corner of the building where there
was a window open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Not all the way; they had it blocked off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you at a later time go over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; not for several days afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you several days afterward go over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. After they released us to go back to work in the corner. We
kept out for several days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went back there, were there two Rolling Readers on top
of a larger box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; those were carried in by the local authorities. The
boxes&mdash;the Rolling Readers were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. But the boxes that they were originally packed in were gone&mdash;they
had been carried up to the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have seen pictures of the window, haven't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With the larger box on the floor and two Rolling Readers on the
top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One Rolling Reader resting in the sill of the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the Rolling Readers were stacked three aisles away, I believe
you testified, haven't you, before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I'm not sure how many aisles we moved all that stock now, but
it was at least three aisles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Away from the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; they were at least half way across the building from this
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever instructed anybody to take two Rolling Readers over
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would it have been unusual for two Rolling Readers to be out of
the stack and over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Very unusual, because they are different size cartons from
everything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean from everything else in the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, from any box on that floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; they were little boxes. The rest of them are pretty good
sized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had had a special place for the Rolling Readers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, the two Rolling Readers that were over in the southeast
corner were out of place, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. They sure were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen them out of place before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen those Rolling Readers in that corner before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, we have seen pictures of a large box on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. You mean the one under the Rolling Readers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The one under the Rolling Readers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It was a carton of "Think and Do" books, first-grade level.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "Think and Do" books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of the first-grade level?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Those cartons were larger than the Rolling Readers, aren't they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. About four time as large.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you describe their size in inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I would say they are around 22 long, 18 wide, and 20 tall,
approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What would you say is the size&mdash;was the size of the Rolling
Reader?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It's about 12 inches long&mdash;6 by 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, was there a place where things and those books were usually
stacked on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Along the west wall all the way across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had been doing work up there that day, had you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; I mean the east wall; I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had they ever been in the west wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; when we moved in that building we put them on the
west wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the west wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. On the west wall; I mean the east wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, the "Think and Do" books were on the east wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And piled how many cartons high?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, there were some of them as high as eight high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, this carton of "Think and Do" books that was on the floor,
near the window, under the two Rolling Readers, was stacked&mdash;would have
been stacked along the east wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No; that was a new title and we didn't have a place for it and
it had been set up on the west wall and when we started laying the floor, we
had to move all of the stock over there, including that particular type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, when you moved the stock, where did you move these "Think
and Do" book cartons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. They are on the south side&mdash;along the south side of the building.
We just had a big line of stock, you know; the first thing that was pulled out,
we would roll it onto the southeast corner, and then the row went right on
back toward the west wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Along the west wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. We started rolling it east and then it went back west and as
you fill in an order, it goes back west, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was also a carton of books where they found some handprints
and they cut a piece out of the top; do you remember that? Don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recognize that carton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. That was another carton of "Think and Do" books&mdash;sixth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were those cartons usually stacked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. They were stacked in the southeast corner on the east wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About where that was found, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the "Think and Do" books for the first-grade level, that was
underneath the two Rolling Readers; was that out of place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far away from the place where those books were usually
stacked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Where they were previously stacked was over near the west
wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But where you had rolled them to; how far was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Oh, about 3 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About 3 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the "Think and Do" books, sixth-grade level, where the piece
had been cut out to examine for his palmprint, was it in its proper place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, all that stock was stacked clear to the south wall on the
east side and some cartons had been moved and stacked on top of some more.
There was an empty spot there and this one particular carton was sitting
on it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; by itself. By the side where the rest of them were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Lee Oswald was a checker, wasn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. An order filler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. An order filler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you recall that when he came to work he used a clipboard
to put his orders on; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir; all of the boys do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All the boys use clipboards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know where Oswald got the clipboard he used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, it was a piece of cardboard, actually, with a clip on it
and it was homemade&mdash;he could have made it himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know who made it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No; I'm not for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you present when the clipboard was found on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It was Frankie Kaiser that found that and came down and told
me and I told Mr. Pinkston with the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go up and look at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I went up with him and he got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a name on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I think it had Frankie's name on it&mdash;Frankie Kaiser's name.
He said he thought that might have been one he had made before&mdash;he was all
times making them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I believe that's all. Your other deposition is going to come down
here and you can sign it at the same time you sign this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. OK; I was coming back up the next day and we were awful
busy down there is the reason I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anyway, it will come down for your signature and you can look it
over and, if you have any corrections to make, correct them and initial them.
That's all, and thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. All right; thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t393">TESTIMONY OF EDWARD SHIELDS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Edward Shields was taken at 4:25 p.m., on May 14, 1964, at
the Texas School Book Depository Building, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give
before this Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. State your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Edward Shields.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I live now at 1432 Stirling. I was living at 414 Cleaves Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I work in the shipping department, but some guy put it down
that I worked as a shipping clerk. I do receiving and shipping with the shipping
department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of what company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. With the Texas School Book Co. at 1917 North Houston, at
the warehouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's how far from the building that is at the corner of Houston
and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Well, I'd say about three blocks down to this old building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you worked for the Texas School Book Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. It will be 14 years the 14th of August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you work in the warehouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you out watching the parade pass by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I'd say from about 5 to 12 to about 10 after 12; I mean, about
5 to 12 to 10 after 12&mdash;I heard the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The shooting was at 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. It was&mdash;that's when we was standing there watching the parade
when it came through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get around to see him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. We just got on the parking lot there because we go up there
and sit down there and talk with James Tracey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is James Tracey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. He was the manager of the lot&mdash;there's somebody else there now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That lot is where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. It's near Record and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Near Record and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you go up there to a parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Well, we go over there every day at noon and talk to the fellow
that ran it, but that's not the same fellow there now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But had you, prior to November 22, 1963, had it been your custom of
going over there to see him at noon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I had been going by there every day at noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Givens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I would be going some days when he wouldn't go, but I would
see him&mdash;James Tracey&mdash;every day at noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, did you go over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I was there&mdash;yes; I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Approximately what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. That was around 5 to 12&mdash;that would be to 5 after 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Givens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. He was there at noon after he had eaten his lunch, I mean,
he come on up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President's motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was it when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I was just standing right around there at Mullendorf's Cafe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At what address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. On Record and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Givens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you hear any shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Yes; I heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you and Givens do after you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. I said, "The President has been shot"; we walked back to the
lot and where Tracey was. I heard one shot and then a pause and then this
repetition&mdash;two shots right behind the other, and I thought it was backfire from
a car and I said, "Someone shot the President."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said, "Someone shot the President"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. That's right, I did. I didn't know what had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Well, Givens run down here&mdash;right down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He ran down here to this building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. He ran down to the next corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was the next corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. That was on Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you come with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. No; I did not&mdash;he had me to stay there at the lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And they all ran down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Givens again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Yes; we came back to the building&mdash;he and Tracey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. We came back down to the Texas School Book Depository
Building here and tried to get in the building and they wouldn't let no one in&mdash;he
couldn't get in and I went on back to the warehouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Givens do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. Well, they came and got him because he was working here and
I was at the warehouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him leave with the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. No; I didn't. I was at the warehouse and he had come here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I believe that's all. This will be written up and you will be asked
to sign it and to make any corrections that you wish, you may make them in
your own handwriting, and somebody will call you from the U.S. attorney's
office and let you know when to come up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shields</span>. OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. I raised up trying to see where they were coming from, where
the sound was coming from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. I was looking&mdash;trying to see and after I heard the third shot,
then Oswald came through on Patton running&mdash;came right through the yard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
front of the big white house&mdash;there's a big two-story white house&mdash;there's two
of them there and he come through the one right on the corner of Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see down to the corner of 10th and Patton to the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. I seen him when he come between the two houses, come around
in front of the last house to get on Patton Street to come out to Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Where was I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. I was there at the back, right at the alley back there about as
far from Patton Street as&mdash;about twice as far from here as to that window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, you were about 10 feet from Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So that you could look up Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. North on Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you saw a man, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see him doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. He came through there running and knocking empty shells
out of his pistol and he had it up just like this with his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With which hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. With his right hand; just kicking them out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes; he had it up just like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How was he kicking them out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. He was rolling them with his hand&mdash;with his thumb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Rolling them with his thumb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Checking them&mdash;he had the pistol up just like this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he use his left hand any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. No; I never did see him use his left hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where was he with reference to the corner of Patton and
10th when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Just as he come around the corner on Patton, he cut through
the yard and missed the corner on 10th and Patton and cut through the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He cut through the yard of the house on the corner of 10th and
Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be the southeast corner, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. The west&mdash;southwest corner&mdash;the southeast corner is where
he started across, but he come out on Patton on the southwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, when you first saw him he was cutting across the
yard of the house on the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he cross Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. No, sir; he come down Patton until he got to about 5 feet
from the corner of Jefferson and then he turned across and went across to the
west corner on Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What side of the street did you see him coming down on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. He was on the left side&mdash;when he come down&mdash;it would be the
east side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, where was Oswald when he passed you going south toward
Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Well, he was between the alley and the driveway coming off
Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he was across the street from you, wasn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. No; he was on this side of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were on the east side of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir; and he was too&mdash;he was on the east side of the street
until he got across our driveway and then he got onto the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How close was he to you when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. I guess he was about 10 feet from me&mdash;maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About 10 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Callaway has told us and we measured it with a tape measure,
that Oswald was on the west side of the street, and we measured it and he
figured it was about 55 feet from him when he passed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Well, he crossed over after he crossed the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Mr. Callaway followed him, you see, we was together&mdash;he was

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. He went west on Jefferson&mdash;on the right-hand side&mdash;going
west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did Callaway do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. He turned around and run back to the street and we helped
load the policeman in the ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you there when the truck came up that was driven by
Benavides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He came up right after this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes; he came up from the east side&mdash;going west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How was this man dressed that had the pistol in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. He had on a pair of black britches and a brown shirt and a
little sort of light-gray-looking jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A gray jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes; a light gray jacket and a white T-shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A white T-shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes; a white T-shirt on under it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, he had a light gray jacket on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. And a brown shirt on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And a white T-shirt on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Underneath it, because this brown shirt was open at the throat
and the white T-shirt under it like this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all I've got to examine you about now, except to show you
these clothes, and they are upstairs. We will go up now and take a look at them.</p>

<p>(At this time Counsel Ball, the witness Guinyard and the reporter Oliver left
the deposing room on the third floor of the Federal Building and resumed in a
deposing room on the fourth floor of the Federal Building and the deposition
proceedings continued as follows:)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Sam, I'll show you an exhibit here, which is a piece of clothing and
which is marked Commission Exhibit No. 150. Have you ever seen this before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When and where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. In Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see anybody wearing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Down in the examining room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When this man came down Patton Street toward Jefferson with
his gun, you have mentioned he had a shirt on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You described that shirt as a brown shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does this look anything like the shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. It looks just like it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw that shirt before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Down at the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you tell them when they showed you this shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. I told them that that's the shirt he had on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the next exhibit here is Commission Exhibit No. 162; have
you ever seen this before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. That's the jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is a gray jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes; that's the gray jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It has a zipper on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say that's the jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes; that he had on in Oak Cliff when he passed the lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That the man with the pistol had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Guinyard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions for you, Sam, and I thank you for coming
down, and you can go home now.</p>

checked them when they were picked up on the sixth floor of the Texas School

now that he was the one who returned the shells to me about 10:00 p.m.

envelope that Detective Sims and I had previously marked. It was then that
I scratched my name on the two shells that were released at 11:45 p.m. to
Agent Vince Drain along with the rifle and other evidence.</p>

<p>Before me, Mary Rattan, a Notary Public in and for said County, State of
Texas, on this day personally appeared Lt. J.&nbsp;C. Day, Dallas Police Department,
who, after being by me duly sworn, on oath deposes and says:</p>

<p>The following affidavit is made to clear up confusion regarding the three
spent 6.5 hulls, commission numbers 543, 544, and 545, found by the 6th floor
window of the Texas School Book Depository on November 22, 1963. The hulls
were picked up by Detective R.&nbsp;M. Sims and Lieutenant J.&nbsp;C. Day and placed
in an envelope. Detective R.&nbsp;L. Studebaker was also present. The envelope was
marked and dated by Sims and Day. Detective Sims took the hulls after they
were checked for fingerprints by Day. The third hull, commission number 545,
was later released directly to the FBI by the Dallas Police Department Homicide
Division. At 10:00 P.M. November 22, 1963, Detective C.&nbsp;N. Dhority
brought the three hulls in the marked envelope back to Lieutenant Day in the
Identification Bureau office to recheck for prints. Dhority retained one hull,
commission number 545 and left the other two, commission numbers 543, 544
along with the envelope with me to be sent to the FBI. Vince Drain, FBI agent,
took custody at 11:45 A.M. the same day. When I appeared before the commission
April 22, 1964, I could not find my name on one of the hulls, identified as
commission number 543, and thought this was the hull that had been retained
by Dhority. On June 8, 1964, the three hulls, commission numbers 543, 544, and
545, were back in Dallas and were examined by Captain G.&nbsp;M. Doughty and
myself at the local FBI office. Close examination with a magnifying glass under
a good light disclosed that my name "Day" was on all three hulls, at the small
end. Also GD for Captain George Doughty was on two of them. Commission
numbers 543 and 544 were the first two sent to Washington on November 22,
1963. They have Doughty's initials where he marked the hulls as they were
released to Vince Drain at 11:45 P.M. on November 22, 1963 by Doughty and
Day. The third hull, commission number 545, does not have Doughty's mark,
but is plainly marked "Day". In Washington, I had numbers 543 and 545
switched because I didn't find my name on number 543. I can identify commission
numbers 543, 544, and 545 from my name on them, as the three hulls
found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository on November 22,
1963. As to the time I scratched my name on the hulls, I do not remember
whether it was at the window when picked up or at 10:00 P.M. November 22,
1963, when they were returned to me by Dhority in the marked envelope. It
had to be one or the other, because this is the only time I had all three hulls in
my possession. Both Detective R.&nbsp;L. Studebaker and Detective R.&nbsp;M. Sims, who
were present at the window when the hulls were picked up, state I marked
them as they were found under the window.</p>

<p>I, Thomas J. Kelley, being first duly sworn do upon oath depose and state:</p>

<p>I am an Inspector in the United States Secret Service assigned to Secret
Service Headquarters in Washington, D.C. On November 22, 1963, I was not
in the City of Dallas at the time of the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy. I was instructed through Deputy Chief Paul Paterni to go to Dallas
directly from Lexington, Kentucky, where I had been engaged in a special
assignment and arrived on Friday evening in Dallas at approximately 10:30 p.m.</p>

<p>I attended a total of four interviews with Lee Harvey Oswald, all of which
were held in the office of Captain J.&nbsp;W. Fritz of the Homicide Bureau of the
Dallas Police Department. Three of these interviews occurred on November 23
and the fourth on November 24. (Prior to my arrival in Dallas, Oswald had
been interrogated on November 22.)</p>

<p>Subsequent to these interviews I dictated summaries from my notes of the
subject matter discussed and these dictated summaries were transmitted to
Chief James J. Rowley on November 29 and December 1, 1963.</p>

<p>Copies of these written summaries are attached to this affidavit as exhibit
A and incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof. The summary
of my last interview with Oswald which occurred on Sunday, November 24, 1963,

to the report of the interview, my report on the circumstances immediately
following the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>I hereby certify that the attached memoranda constitute my total written

<p>Three spent rifle hulls were found under the window in the southeast corner
of the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building, Dallas, Texas,
on the afternoon of November 22, 1963. When the officers called me to this
window, I asked them not to move the shells nor touch them until Lt. Day of the
Dallas Police Department could make pictures of the hulls showing where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
fell after being ejected from the rifle. After the pictures were made, Detective
R.&nbsp;M. Sims of the Homicide Bureau, who was assisting in the search of the
building, brought the three empty hulls to my office. These were delivered to
me in my office at the police headquarters. I kept the hulls in an envelope in
my possession and later turned them over to C.&nbsp;N. Dhority of the Homicide
Bureau and instructed him to take them to Lt. Day of the Identification Bureau.
I told Detective Dhority that after these hulls were checked for prints to leave
two of them to be delivered to the FBI and to bring one of them to my office
to be used for comparison tests here in the office, as we were trying to find
where the cartridges had been bought. When Detective Dhority returned from
the Identification Bureau, he returned the one empty hull which I kept in my
possession. Several days later, I believe on the night of November 27, Vince
Drain of the FBI called me at home about one o'clock in the morning and said
that the Commission wanted the other empty hull and a notebook that belonged
to Oswald. I came to the office and delivered these things to the FBI. We have
Mr. James P. Hosty's receipt for these items in our report.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Reference to the Testimony of Roger Craig</i></p>

<p>I don't remember the name Roger Craig, but I do remember a man coming
into my outer office and I remember one of my officers calling me outside the
door of my private office. I talked to this man for a minute or two, and he
started telling me a story about seeing Oswald leaving the building. I don't
remember all the things that this man said, but I turned him over to Lt. Baker
who talked to him. Lee Harvey Oswald was in my office at this time. I don't
remember anything about Lee Harvey Oswald jumping up or making any remarks
or gestures to this man or to me at this time, and had I brought this
officer into my inner office I feel sure that I would remember it. There were
other officers in my inner office at the time, and I have found no one who
knows about the remarks that you have asked about.</p>

<h2 id="t404">TESTIMONY OF MRS. MARY JANE ROBERTSON</h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Mary Jane Robertson was taken at 12:20 p.m., on May
28, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mrs. Mary Jane Robertson.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Robertson, my name is Leon D. Hubert, and I am a member
of the advisory staff of the general counsel on the President's Commission
on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Under the provisions of Executive
Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the joint resolution of Congress No. 137,
and the rules of procedure adopted by the President's Commission in conformance
with the Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized
to take a sworn deposition from you. I state to you now that the general
nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon
the facts relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent
violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular, as to you, Mrs. Robertson,
the nature of the inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the
death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know about the general
inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Robertson, I believe that you appear here today by virtue of a
general request made to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, general counsel of the
President's Commission, in a letter addressed by him to Chief Curry, asking
Chief Curry to request that you come here. Under the rules adopted by the
Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
this deposition, but the rules adopted also provide that a witness may waive this
3-day notice if he sees fit to do so. Now, I must first ask you if you wish to
receive the 3-day notice, or whether you are willing to waive it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I am quite willing to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you rise then, and raise your right hand so that I may
administer the oath?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name, please, ma'am?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. My name is Mary Jane Robertson or Mrs. Jim G. Robertson,
as I go by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your present residence address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. 619 Lacewood, L-a-c-e-w-o-o-d [spelling] Drive, in Dallas,
of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I am classified as a clerk-typist with the city civil service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes&mdash;Dallas&mdash;and I work in the special service bureau of the
Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you are a civil service employee but assigned
to the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so assigned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Just about a year and a half&mdash;October the 1st I started
to work there, so just about a year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, were you there on Friday, November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The day the President was killed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; I certainly was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what time you went to work there and what
time you left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; at that time I was coming to work at 7:15 and leaving
at 4:15&mdash;those were my hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At 7:15 in the morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. At 7:15 in the morning and leaving at 4:15 in the afternoon.
Now, as to the exact time I left that afternoon, I cannot tell you to the minute
because, well, further on in the testimony you will probably want to ask, but
Jack Revill, Lieutenant Revill, asked me to take a letter for him, the exact
time of which I cannot tell you, but I do remember this very well&mdash;my husband
had a vacation. He had been on a hunting trip and he was at home, so when
Jack asked me to write this letter I went in and phoned home and I said, "I
might run just a few minutes late because I don't know if this will be a long
letter or a short letter, or what it will consist of," and I did have the car, and
ordinarily I would have been home, say, leaving the office at 4:15, in 20 or 25
minutes, you know, but I did get home more or less around 5 o'clock&mdash;which
was the usual time. I mean, I didn't run, you know, real late or anything, but
that part&mdash;I definitely remember, and my husband does, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the letter of Lt. Jack Revill you just talked about was the
thing that caused you to be delayed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. That was what I stayed to write&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is a fact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. That is a fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that was the last thing you did that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; when I completed the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally, you would have left at 4:15?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; and I am saying that I didn't run too much after 4:15&mdash;the
point of it&mdash;now, exactly what time I started on that&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally, how long would it take you to get to your home from
your office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Well, you see, if I leave at 4:15 I make a little better time
than if you wait until 4:30 because the more traffic starts then, and it's hard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
say exactly, but I go on the freeway, and it's probably 20 minutes and if it's
heavy traffic probably 25&mdash;you know what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be fair to state, then, that you probably left at about
4:30?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I would assume so. Now, I'm not saying to the very minute
or anything like that, but I am saying that approximately&mdash;if it was after 5
o'clock, it was very shortly after when I got in the car, you know, I did not run
what you would call late by hours or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I'm going to show you two documents, but I want to
identify them with reference to your deposition, so I am marking a document
which has been already identified as Commission Exhibit No. 838, as follows:
"Dallas, Texas, May 28, 1964, Exhibit No. 1, of the deposition of Mrs. Mary Jane
Robertson," and I am signing my name below that, all of which appears in the
left margin, and I am doing precisely the same to the other document, which
bears the identification, Commission Exhibit No. 709, except that I am marking
this as Exhibit No. 2 of the deposition of Mary Jane Robertson, signing my name
to that.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Robertson, I would ask you to look at Exhibit No. 1 and Exhibit No.
2 which are identified and ask you if that is the letter to which you have
previously referred as having been written or typed by you for Lieutenant
Revill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I didn't this&mdash;because I know nothing about this down here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are pointing to Exhibit No. 1 and you are covering with
your hand the affidavit portion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you know nothing about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The letter itself, you have noticed that they are actually identical,
one appears to be an original and the other a copy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. That's right&mdash;I was trying to see if there was a difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember writing these letters yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Why, yes; I wrote them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything on the letter that identifies you as having
written them, I mean like the usual little marks put on the letter by a
stenographer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. No; that's something I always do, but what I mean, the
state of confusion&mdash;well&mdash;I'm sure you can't have a conception of the state of
confusion that office was in&mdash;our main secretary was out, she had a dental appointment
and she had left earlier that morning, there were only two girls in
the office and the two deskmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you do identify the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Definitely&mdash;I identify the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You identify it from the sense of it or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Well, this is something that I did not memorize verbatim,
and could not have repeated&mdash;what I mean&mdash;per word, but I could have told
you the general gist of the letter, is what I mean, yes&mdash;the actual facts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it dictated to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Lieutenant Revill came in and said, "Mary Jane, I would
like for you to take a letter," and like I said, our stenographer was out of the
office on an appointment, and I said, "Of course, now, Jack, this has been a hard
day and you know I don't take shorthand and if you will be patient with me
and let me write it out in longhand, I will be happy to do it for you." That is
when I made my phone call home, and so he said, "Well, you take your time,"
and he said, "I know you don't take shorthand and that's quite all right," and
I had him even spell such names so as to be certain of&mdash;you know&mdash;the agent's
name and all like that. He sat across the desk from me, as we are doing here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it was written out in your hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; now, Jack, as I remember&mdash;I speak of him, we are
very informal in our office, as Lieutenant Revill&mdash;Lieutenant Revill, as I recall,
did have several papers or rough drafts that possibly he had written out or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
something, but he did speak verbally to me and I wrote in my own handwriting
and I used a shorthand notebook. I wrote in my own handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you used your own handwriting for the purpose of
writing the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do with your own handwriting notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Anything like that I always take and I tear up and put in
the wastebasket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think that's what happened here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Well, I'm certain it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don't know the existence of those notes now, is what
I am getting at?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how many copies you made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. There again, I could not swear to you under oath exactly.
Ordinarily we make an original and five. Now, whether Lieutenant Revill just
might have said that an original and three will be enough, I cannot tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't know how many you made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. No&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I absolutely do not remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the normal practice would have been to make more than
one copy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. More than the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. More than the original and one copy&mdash;normally you would write
the original and how many copies?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Now, by this going to the captain that is not necessarily so.
Anything we address to the chief we would have definitely more than one
carbon copy, but for little instances like that, I cannot remember&mdash;Lieutenant
Revill just might have said "an original and one will be enough."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall that he did say so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I do not&mdash;absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you don't really know how many you did make?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I cannot tell you&mdash;I cannot remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When the letter was finished, what happened to it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I called Lieutenant Revill, as well as I can remember, I called
him into my office. Now, I might have gone into his office, but I took it directly
to him. I waited and let him read it and let him proof it over to see it and
I know he questioned me&mdash;he said, "Are you sure this is the correct way to
spell assassination?" And I said, "Yes, sir; I looked it up in the dictionary,"
and he read the letter and then as I remember, I got my personal belongings
together and I left the building then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you handed the original and copy or copies to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Directly to Lieutenant Revill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you don't know what he did with it, to your own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Oh, no; I left the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about what the figures in the lower
right-hand corner on Exhibit 1, that is to say, Commission Exhibit No. 838,
mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do they mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. The captain has files of copies and that is his own, and his
own personal file. In fact, he gave me a letter, a photostat, which he said it
would be quite all right to show that that is his own and that that appears on his
file, you know what I mean, the way he has it set up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. The O-1 is what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are showing me a document that is exactly the same
actually, it seems to be a photostatic copy of Exhibits Nos. 1 and 2, that you
have just testified to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. That's right, this is in the captain's files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is from the captain's flies and in the left-hand side it shows
"WPG"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. That's Capt. W.&nbsp;P. Gannaway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then over on the right-hand side it has "O-1" and you
say that those are his initials on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand
side is what, that is his indexing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Correct&mdash;this is not in the outside file or anything, it's in
the captain's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would that indicate that there is another copy other than the
two that you have just testified to, being Commission Exhibits Nos. 838 and 709?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Well, sir, will you phrase that again, I don't understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you will notice that in Commission Exhibits Nos. 838 and
709, both of which have been identified, respectively, as Exhibits Nos. 1 and 2
for this deposition, do not have on the left-hand side the initials of Captain
Gannaway. Now, it could be that this document you have just showed me is
another copy or another photostat initialed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Sir, I don't know. He called me in his office yesterday and
handed me the letter and I read it. I said, "Yes, Captain Gannaway, this is the
letter. I assume I typed it because this is the contents of the letter that I typed."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you remembered it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; so he handed it to me and he said, "Well, take this
along," and he said, "This, of course, Mary Jane, you well know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about the "O-1"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. The O-1, I don't ask questions, but I mean, he has a file, of
course, of the documents pertaining to this and so he said, "Would you return
the letter to me when you return from taking your deposition?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn't authorize you to let me have this letter that you have
just showed me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, as I said before, I think you will agree with me that this
letter seems to be exactly the same as the other two, with the exception that
on the one that you have produced there are in the left-hand corner, the initials
WPG, which you say you identify as being the initials of Captain Gannaway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us anything about the other markings and symbols
on the bottom of Commission Exhibit No. 838? I refer first to seemingly a rubber
stamp in a square called "Indexed date 4-27-4" and the initial "S." Can you
tell me what that means?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I have no idea in the world, sir. I have never seen a stamp
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then below that, the initials "Int," this being in writing,
and then "2965-34," do you know what that means?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I have no idea. Now, there again is our O-1, which would be
in our captain's files. Now, whether this is something pertaining&mdash;I do not know
whether this is something pertaining to his files only, this subject matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case, from your own knowledge, except for the O-1,
as to which you have already testified, the rubber stamp and the other figures
in the lower right-hand corner in Exhibit No. 1 in this deposition, being Commission
Exhibit No. 838, as to those you know nothing about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I know nothing, sir. Once I handed the letter to Lieutenant
Revill, then I never saw the letter again until I was called into the captain's
office yesterday. I remember it in my mind, but as far as seeing the actual
document, I had not seen the actual document, I mean a copy of it or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it would be possible for you to call Captain Gannaway
and see if he would give you authority to let me have that copy that you
have shown us or perhaps take a photostat of it; can you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes; I will do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose we take a few minutes recess, then, and you call
Captain Gannaway and ask him if we might have that copy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. All right; I will.</p>

<p>(At this point the proceedings of the deposition of Mrs. Robertson were recessed,
during which time Mrs. Robertson made the call heretofore referred to,
and the proceedings were continued as hereinafter shown.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Robertson, you have attempted to reach Captain Gannaway
to see if he could give you permission to either let me have a photocopy made of
this letter which you showed me, or else have a copy of that made, but at the
moment you have not been able to reach him.</p>

<p>Suppose we do this. I have already asked you all the questions that I would
ask you about the document, and suppose we do it this way&mdash;that if you do
secure permission to give it to me, then when it is delivered at a later time today
or at the latest, tomorrow, I will mark it as Exhibit No. 3 of your deposition, do
you understand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By simply writing my name and the date and then all of the
testimony which you have previously given as to that document heretofore, but
which did not refer to a numbered exhibit will apply to Exhibit No. 3; is that
all right? Do you understand what I mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Yes&mdash;I see&mdash;I understand what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that Captain Gannaway, from what you told
me, called you in yesterday and spoke to you about this. Has anyone else spoken
to you about this recently, at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. No, captain&mdash;I assume it was from this letter that was addressed
to the chief requiring my testimony on this&mdash;the captain just said I was
needed and that I had a choice of Thursday or Friday and which would be
more convenient?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I understand, and then he asked you if you remembered it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. He asked me first if I remembered the letter, and I said, "Yes,
very well," and I repeated the gist of the contents to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the only time anyone had spoken to you about the
letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Well, when Lieutenant Revill went to Washington, I believe,
he went a matter of a week or 2 weeks ago and he said at that time when he
came back, when he returned from Washington, he said, "Mary Jane, you know
they may need your testimony on it," and I said, "Well, that's fine. I certainly
remember the day, and I certainly remember the incident," and other than that
there has been no discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there is no doubt in your mind that it was written, as you
say, on the afternoon of November 22, approximately between the hours of 4
and 4:30 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I would say that it was written more between&mdash;yes&mdash;about
then, because I was thinking from the&mdash;actually the time he started giving it to
me and all that&mdash;actually the typing and waiting for him to proofread it and
all like that&mdash;that I am sure&mdash;because I went directly home to my family and
told my husband that I had typed the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there can be no doubt about it being November 22, either?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. No doubt in the world.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, Mrs. Robertson, thank you very much. As soon as you
find out from Captain Gannaway, perhaps you can arrange some way to get the
document delivered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Shall I personally have to deliver that to you, or can it be
sent by one of the officers? Is there a requirement about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just so that it is identified more particularly with your testimony,
if you get permission to hand me that document, or deliver it in person,
that's all that will be necessary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Well, I'm quite sure the captain will not object.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you want to send it over, I would like you to place your name
on it just so that we will know it is the document we are talking about, because
after all, this is going to be read by people later, and we know what we are
talking about, but we must make it clear that others will know from the whole
record what it is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. I see, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you, very much, and I appreciate your assistance.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. All right.</p>

<h2 id="t410">TESTIMONY OF LYNDAL L. SHANEYFELT</h2>

<p>The testimony of Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt was taken at 3:40 p.m., on June 12,
1964, at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Mr. Melvin Aron
Eisenberg, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">(The oath was administered by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you state your full name, Mr. Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you have testified before the Commission in this proceeding
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. We will not rehearse your qualifications again, since you have
already been accepted as an expert in the field in which you are going to be
questioned today.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaneyfelt, I hand you a photograph marked Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1,
consisting of a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald holding a rifle, and I ask you
whether you prepared that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is this a photograph of an existing Commission exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; this is a copy of the small photograph that is a part
of Commission Exhibit No. 133.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That would be 133-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I don't recall whether it is A or B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I hand you photographs of Commission Exhibits Nos. 133-A
and 133-B and ask if this serves to refresh your recollection as to whether
Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1 is a photograph of 133-A or 133-B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1 is a copy of the Commission
Exhibit No. 133-A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Shaneyfelt, I hand you the cover of Life magazine,
issue of February 21, 1964, which I have labeled Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 2, and
I ask you if this is a photograph which you have previously examined in connection
with earlier testimony given by you to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I hand you page 80 of the same issue of Life, which is labeled
Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 3, and I ask you the same question, that is, whether this
is the photograph you have previously discussed in connection with earlier
testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, for the record, I am using duplicate originals rather
than the actual exhibits, because the actual exhibits are now being printed up
by the Government Printing Office.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaneyfelt, I hand you the front page of the Detroit Free Press, issue
of February 17, 1964, containing a picture similar to Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1,
and the other pictures thus far referred to&mdash;and I am labeling this Detroit Free
Press page Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4&mdash;and ask you whether you have examined
the picture of Lee Harvey Oswald and a rifle appearing on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you compare this picture with 133-A or Shaneyfelt Exhibit
No. 1, your reproduction of 133-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your conclusion on the basis of that comparison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I found that the reproduction of the photograph of Oswald
holding the gun on Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4 has insufficient detail to warrant
positive identification as being the same photograph as Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>However, I did find that the photograph in the newspaper, Exhibit No. 4,
is consistent in all respects with the photograph which is Exhibit No. 1, except
for variations in retouching that are a normal part of the process of making
halftone reproductions from photographs for newspapers. I further found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
there was nothing in these photographs to indicate that they are other than the
same photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, when you say that the only variations appear to be
variations in retouching, that would be based on the conclusion that they were
the same photograph, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you describe those variations which are apparently due
to retouching, Mr. Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes. There is an area to the right of Oswald's head and
shoulder, to my left as I look at the photograph, that has been airbrushed or
otherwise altered, to intensify the outline of the shoulder, which would be Oswald's
shoulder.</p>

<p>In addition there is retouching around the stock of the rifle, and along the
other portions of the rifle where it crosses Oswald's body, that has been added
to intensify the detail in that portion of the photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say "around the stock," could you specify as to
whether you mean the top, bottom, end, or all three or any two of those
boundaries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. In Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4 there is retouching on both the
top and bottom and butt of the stock, and also a highlight running along the
top of the gun from the bolt forward toward the muzzle.</p>

<p>There is an additional highlight along the bottom of the gun just forward
of the trigger assembly between the trigger assembly and the hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, there is a highlight on Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1 running
near the top of the barrel or receiver, is that correct&mdash;terminating at Oswald's
left hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is the relation between the highlight at the top of the
barrel or receiver in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4 and the highlight just referred
to in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. In Exhibit No. 1, that highlight along the bolt of the gun is
in two parts, and the highlight in the photograph or the reproduction of the
photograph, Exhibit No. 4, is a continuous highlight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is it your opinion that the highlight in Shaneyfelt Exhibit
No. 4 is based upon the highlight in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But it differs, at least, in that it makes a continuous highlight
where none appears in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1, is that your testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1, a telescopic sight is apparent
on the rifle, and no such sight is apparent in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4.
Do you have any opinion as to the reason for the lack of a sight appearing on
Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give that opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I believe that the sight does not appear in the reproduction
of the photograph on Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4, because it was not retouched to
intensify the detail of the sight, and, therefore was lost in the engraving process.
I do not believe that there was any retouching over the sight in order
to purposely obliterate it from the reproduction in Exhibit No. 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, is there generally a loss of detail in reproduction of
illustrations appearing in newspapers, Mr. Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; there is. This is apparent in other areas of this
photograph when compared with Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1, in areas of Oswald's
shirt, where wrinkling appears in Exhibit No. 1, and is lost in the reproduction.
Also, the wrinkles in the dark areas of the trousers are not reproduced in the
halftone process, but this detail is lost by the process.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is this halftone process which you mention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. This is the halftone process by which a continuous tone
photograph, such as Exhibit No. 1, is photographed through a screen so that
it can be broken up into a dot pattern of black dots on a white background and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
white dots on a black background to give the appearance of a continuous tone
in the printed newspaper reproduction. And this is the only means by which
a continuous-tone photograph can be reproduced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why is it called a halftone process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I don't really know the answer but I would assume that it
is because it gives you the tones in between black and white, or the halftones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, a loss of detail is inherent in this process, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is true, particularly in regard to newspaper reproductions,
where a relatively coarse screen is used in making the halftone. In a
magazine publication, where a higher quality of printing is used, and a better
quality of paper is used, it is possible to use a finer screen and thereby retain a
greater amount of the detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, referring once more to the highlight running along the
top of the weapon, and terminating at Oswald's left hand in Shaneyfelt Exhibit
No. 4; when you compare this exhibit with Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1, does
it appear that that highlight actually runs along the top of the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. In the reproduction of the photograph on Exhibit No. 4, the
impression is given that the highlight is along the top of the rifle, because you
see no additional detail above that highlight along the top of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, if you compare that with Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1, where
a similar highlight appears, does that highlight actually denote the top of the
weapon, or is any detail above the highlight apparent in Shaneyfelt Exhibit
No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. On Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1, the highlight does not denote
the top of the weapon. There is detail present that shows other areas of the
gun, the breech, above the highlight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, would you say then that detail of the weapon itself,
that is, the upper part of the weapon, had been lost along with detail representing
the telescopic sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Bringing your attention back to Shaneyfelt Exhibits Nos.
2 and 3, which are the Life photographs, how did these photographs compare
with Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4, the Detroit Free Press photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. The primary difference is in the retouching. In the area
above and behind Oswald's right shoulder, the background has been retouched
out on Exhibit No. 4, the Detroit Free Press. In the Life magazine reproduction,
Exhibit No. 2, the background has been left in, and the retouching has been
added to the shirt area around the right shoulder to enhance the detail along in
that area.</p>

<p>The Life magazine reproduction, Exhibit No. 2, also has retouching around the
scope of the rifle in order that it will not blend into the dark shirt that Oswald
was wearing and thus be lost in the reproduction process; this has not been
done in Exhibit No. 4. The retouching along the top of the rifle stock is
generally similar, in that it is in a straight line from the butt of the stock to
the bolt. However, Exhibit No. 4 has a different type of retouching along the
end or butt of the stock and the bottom of the stock or the lower edge of the
stock between the butt and the trigger guard. Highlights along the top and
bottom of the breech area are different in Exhibit No. 4 than in Exhibit No. 2.</p>

<p>There is a dark shadow between the legs of Oswald that is about halfway
between the knee and the crotch that has been left in the reproduction of Exhibit
No. 4, but has been retouched out of the Life magazine reproduction, Exhibit
No. 2. These are the primary variations in the retouching on the two
exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does the highlight running at or near the top of the receiver
or barrel in the bolt area show a continuous or an intermittent form in Commission
Exhibit No. 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 2 shows a break in the highlight
along the bolt, and is reproduced very close to the original photograph, which is
Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>In fact, this area was probably not retouched, or this highlight was probably
not retouched, for the Life magazine reproduction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you also mentioned that the retouching along the stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
was different when Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 2 is compared with Shaneyfelt
Exhibit No. 4. Could you go into a little bit of detail on that difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I mentioned that the highlight along the top from the
butt to the bolt is generally similar in that it is in a straight line. Although
the rifle itself is actually curved along that area, they both have been retouched
in a relatively straight line along the top edge of the stock. There has been a
white or light line added along the butt of the stock where it crosses Oswald's
leg in Exhibit No. 4 and this has not been done in Exhibit No. 2. In addition, a
white outline has been drawn in along the bottom edge of the stock as it runs
from the butt to the trigger guard in Exhibit No. 4. This has not been done in
Exhibit No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Shaneyfelt, when retouching is effected, is it performed
on a negative or on a print?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Retouching for newspaper reproduction is almost always
done on the print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what about magazine reproductions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. This would also be true of magazine reproductions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And would that explain how Shaneyfelt Exhibits Nos. 2 and
4 could differ from each other, even though they were apparently both taken
from the same print, originally from the same print, of which Shaneyfelt Exhibit
No. 1 is a photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; that would explain the difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is&mdash;could you go into detail on that? Could you elaborate
that answer? By what process would the result of a reproduction of the same
print differ, as reproduced in two different media or two different magazines
or newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Well, the primary variation would be in the retouching that
has been added. Different publications and different retouch artists would handle
a photograph differently, and add different retouching to them. Therefore,
these would be the main variations which you would have between two different
reproductions. In addition there can also be differences in the quality of the
engraving, as there are differences in quality of many things. A newspaper
reproduction is made with a coarser screen and gives less detail than a magazine
reproduction that uses a finer screen and, therefore, reproduces more detail.
These are some of the basic things that would affect these reproductions and
make variations in the reproductions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Shaneyfelt, I hand you page 80 of Newsweek magazine,
issue of March 2, 1964, also containing a photograph like those we have
been examining, and this is marked Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 5, and I ask you
whether you have examined that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give us your conclusions, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I found that the photograph reproduced in the Newsweek
magazine, issue of March 2, 1964, which has been marked as Shaneyfelt Exhibit
No. 5, is the same in all general characteristics as the photograph that has
been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 133-A, and I found no differences to
suggest that it is other than the same <span class="locked">photograph&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Except for variations in retouching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I take it that your testimony concerning Shaneyfelt Exhibits
Nos. 4 and 5 is that due to some loss of detail it is impossible to say that these
photographs are identical to Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1&mdash;or rather Exhibit No.
133-A, on which Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1 is based&mdash;in the same way you can say
that a fingerprint is identical to a given fingerprint impression; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct. I was not able to positively identify them,
because of this loss of detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is your opinion as to the probability that they are
identical, bearing in mind that it is impossible to make an absolute unqualified
determination of identity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. They may very well be identical since I found no significant
differences other than the retouching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there much doubt in your mind?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Very little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Apart from the factors which have been mentioned so far as
apparently due to retouching, and those factors which you have not yet discussed
but will, was there any difference between the reproductions and the
original, between the apparent reproductions and the original? That is, was
lighting the same, position, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I found them to be the same in all of these general
characteristics as to lighting and position of hands and position of body, their
relation to the background. I found no differences whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that for the photograph to be a different photograph, I
take it, you would have had to have Oswald line up exactly in the same position,
with his elbows and torso in precisely the same relative position, with the rifle
at precisely the same relative height and in precisely the same relative position
as it had been in previously, with the lighting casting the exact same shadows,
insofar as shadows are visible, and so forth, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you found no discrepancies in those items I have just
mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>To make the record complete, is there any other possibility, no matter how
remote?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; even though it would be extremely remote, it is conceivable
that a person could actually make a drawing or painting of a picture
exactly like this, that when reproduced in a newspaper or publication with
its loss of detail would resemble Commission Exhibit No. 133-A, in the same
manner that this picture or this reproduction resembles Exhibit No. 133-A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. "This reproduction" being which, Mr. Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Either Exhibit No. 4, or Exhibit No. 5, Exhibit No. 2, any
of the magazine or newspaper reproductions that we have discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You are not talking about Commission Exhibit No. 133-A
itself, which you testified to earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you see any evidence of this, Mr. Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. No; I do not, and I think it is in the realm of unreasonable
doubt and it is highly improbable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Returning to Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 5, could you describe
the apparent retouching in that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; there is airbrushing in the background area that shows
beside the right shoulder of Oswald, where the tree that shows in Exhibit No. 1
has been airbrushed out to a darkened area. There have been highlights added to
the rifle, a straight highlight along the top of the stock, running from the butt
of the stock to the bolt, a bright highlight along the butt of the stock.</p>

<p>There has been rather elaborate retouching around the bolt area or breech
area of the rifle. The highlight that appears in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1 along
the bolt of the gun, which appears as a broken line or two segments of a line
or highlight, appears in the reproduction on Exhibit No. 5 as a broken line very
much like the actual highlight in the photograph which is Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>There has been a highlight added parallel to that, along the bottom of or just
below that area in the reproduction on Exhibit No. 5, which does not appear
in Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>The top of the rifle has been emphasized with a strong highlight, and the
highlight in the reproduction of Exhibit No. 5 along the top of the rifle does not
conform to the actual top of the rifle as it can be seen in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>There are some other highlights added above that, that are rather unexplainable
but may be highlights relative to the lower portion of the scope.</p>

<p>Also a highlight has been added along the top of the barrel between Oswald's
left hand and where the barrel extends past his left shoulder.</p>

<p>There has been some retouching added around the pistol on the right hip
of Oswald, and around the holster. These are the primary points that have been
retouched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Shaneyfelt, does this photograph, Shaneyfelt Exhibit No.
5, more closely resemble the Detroit Free Press photograph, which is Shaneyfelt
Exhibit No. 4, or the Life photographs, Shaneyfelt Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. It corresponds to the reproduction in the Detroit Free Press,
Exhibit No. 4, and not as well to the reproduction on Exhibit No. 2, which is the
Life magazine. In fact, the reproductions on Exhibits Nos. 4 and No. 5 both
have two white specks along the right leg between the knee and the right foot,
centrally located in that area one above the other, that do not appear in the
original photograph, which is Commission Exhibit 133-A, and do not appear in
the Life magazine reproduction on either Exhibit No. 2 or 3. This would indicate
to me that these two photographs may have originated from the same basic
source or basic print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, in fact, the credit under Shaneyfelt No. 5 says, "Copyright
1964, Detroit Free Press," is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But is the picture identical in all respects to the Detroit Free
Press picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. No; the retouching, particularly around the breech of the
rifle in Exhibit No. 5, which is the Newsweek reproduction, is different than the
retouching on the reproduction in Exhibit No. 4, the Detroit Free Press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does the reproduction around the breech, that is, just below
Oswald's left hand, correspond to anything you have ever seen on a rifle, Mr.
Shaneyfelt&mdash;that is, the four or five roughly parallel lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. No; it doesn't correspond to anything that I recall having
seen on a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What do you think the genesis of all those lines would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I believe that they are possibly the artist's interpretation of
how the rifle may have looked in that area, since the photograph being retouched
was indistinct in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you say that would be likely to have been done by a
person not familiar with rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is a possibility, but I wouldn't be able to state that
with any degree of certainty. That is one possibility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I also see that Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 4 has an arrow pointing
to the revolver, which is not present in Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 5, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain why Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 5 differs from
Exhibit No. 4, although it seems to be substantially similar, and in fact Newsweek
credits its photo to the Detroit Free Press, which is the Shaneyfelt Exhibit
No. 4 picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I would attribute these differences to the differences in
retouching. Since it would be normal procedure in publications of this type for
each publication to do its own retouching for its own reproductions, they would
normally receive the picture in an unretouched condition from whatever source
is available, such as the Associated Press, or, as in Exhibit No. 3, the credit to
the Detroit Free Press, and after receiving the unretouched photograph, would
then add the retouching that they desired to have on the photo before making
the halftone reproduction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The area to the right of Oswald's shoulder and head, that is, to
the left of the shoulder and head as we look at the picture, appears to be retouched
or airbrushed out in the same way in both pictures. Would that be
your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; with one exception, that while the airbrushing is generally
similar, it appears in the Detroit Free Press, which is Exhibit No. 4, as a
light area against a black shirt, while in Newsweek, Exhibit No. 5, it appears
as a black area against a rather dark shirt, with a light highlight added along the
shoulder to make the area stand out against the background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is it your conclusion, then, that two separate retouchings were
done to accomplish that effect, one retouching by the Newsweek people and one
retouching by the Detroit Free Press people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I have no foundation on which to base a positive statement
in that regard, but this is suggested by the variations that are present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that the presence of that same feature as a retouch in both
photographs might be coincidental, or at least might not have been done by the
same person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And in your mind that similarity of feature does not preclude
the possibility that a completely unretouched photo was submitted by the Detroit
Free Press to Newsweek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Shaneyfelt, I hand you page 30 of the New York
Times, issue of February 19, 1964, which again contains a photograph similar
to those you have been testifying as to&mdash;and which page I have marked Shaneyfelt
Exhibit No. 6&mdash;and I ask you whether you have examined that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what is your conclusion concerning that photograph, Mr.
Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I found this to be generally similar in all visible characteristics
to the photograph which is Commission Exhibit No. 133-A, and found no
differences to suggest that it is other than the same photograph as Exhibit No.
133-A. However, the lack of detail in the halftone reproduction on Shaneyfelt
Exhibit No. 6 precludes a positive identification with Commission Exhibit No.
133-A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you see any retouching in this photograph, Mr. Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. In the photograph reproduced on Exhibit No. 6 this is retouched
along the right shoulder and to the right side of the face of Oswald. In
this instance, that has been put in in a solid medium gray, to make it appear as
the extension of the building or the fence that appears in the background of the
original photograph.</p>

<p>There is retouching around the rifle stock&mdash;in fact, the stock itself seems to
have been lightened all along the lower portion near the butt; a highlight along
the top has been retouched along the top from the butt to the breech; some retouching
along the butt of the stock, and also along the bottom edge of the stock,
running upward toward the trigger.</p>

<p>The highlight that appears in Exhibit No. 1 along the bolt as a two-section highlight
or a broken highlight appears in this same general area on the gun in the
reproduction on Exhibit No. 6 as a solid highlight and one continuous line.
There has been a highlight added along the bottom of the gun just forward of the
trigger guard and just below Oswald's left hand. Also a highlight has been
added along the top of the gun above Oswald's left hand to show the gun as
apart from the dark shirt, so that the gun and shirt do not blend into one continuous
tone at that point. There appears to be some retouching of Oswald's
shadow, in that it has been toned down to a medium gray shadow so that it
will not blend into the lower portion of his legs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which of the reproductions which you have so far examined
does this most resemble, Mr. Shaneyfelt: the Detroit Free Press, the Life, or
the Newsweek reproduction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. This corresponds to both the Detroit Free Press and the
Newsweek reproductions of the photograph, in that it contains the two white
dots along the right leg, centrally located between the ankle and the knee as
they appear in those two reproductions, and, therefore, may be derived from
the same basic print, since this characteristic does not appear in Commission
Exhibit No. 133-A or in the Life magazine reproductions on Shaneyfelt Exhibits
Nos. 2 and 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What about the retouching in the New York Times photograph,
Mr. Shaneyfelt, how does that compare with the retouching in the Detroit Free
Press and Newsweek photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. The retouching is different from any of the other Exhibits
Nos. 4 and 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you conclude, therefore, that the New York Times, like
Newsweek, may have received from its source an unretouched photograph which
it proceeded to retouch?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that again the similarity in retouching to the upper right
of Oswald's shoulder and head might be coincidental?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; actually, there is considerable difference in the retouching
in that area on the New York Times photograph as compared to the Newsweek
and Detroit Free Press exhibits. The New York Times has attempted to
make it appear as a wall, whereas the other two have merely airbrushed out the
line, and it looks like foliage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The stock in all three of these photographs, that is, Detroit
Free Press, Newsweek, and New York Times, has also been retouched in a similar
manner, that is, so that the top of the stock appears straight, whereas actually
the top of the stock is curved&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What do you think accounts for the coincidence of the retouching
in these two areas&mdash;that is, the top of the stock and the area to the upper
right of Oswald's shoulder&mdash;given the differences you have noted in the details
of retouching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I would attribute that to a lack of detail in the photographs
that they had, and a lack of understanding of the formation of a normal rifle
stock on the part of the retoucher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Shaneyfelt, I hand you the front page of the New
York Journal-American, issue of February 18, 1964, which again contains a
photograph similar to those you have been discussing, and which I have labeled
Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 7, and ask you whether you have examined that
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. It is my conclusion that this photograph is the same in all
visible characteristics as the photograph which is Commission Exhibit No. 133-A,
and I found no differences that would suggest that it is other than the same
photograph. However, because of the lack of detail in the reproduction on
Exhibit No. 7, it is not possible to positively identify it as the same photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is retouching apparent in this photograph, Mr. Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you describe that in detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; there has been retouching along the right shoulder
of Oswald, and to some degree around the head, in order to have the head and
shoulder not blend into the background. This appears to have been done by
increasing the highlight or lightening the highlight along the shoulder, rather
than darkening the background.</p>

<p>There is a highlight added along the top of the rifle stock that runs quite
straight toward the bolt, but it is not as strong a highlight as in the other
reproductions we have discussed. There is a highlight along the top of the rifle
between Oswald's left hand and the point where the rifle passes his left shoulder.
There is a suggestion of some retouching around the rifle scope, which is
almost lost in the detail or almost lost against the black shirt, but it is barely
visible. There is a dark shadow that appears in Commission Exhibit No. 133-A
that has been retouched out of Exhibit No. 7 reproduction, that shadow being
about halfway between the knee and the crotch of the trousers between the legs.
Those are the primary points of retouching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which of the various photographs which you have examined
does this Journal-American photograph most resemble, Mr. Shaneyfelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. The Journal-American photograph reproduction on Exhibit
No. 7 is different from the Detroit Free Press, Exhibit No. 4, Newsweek, Exhibit
No. 5, and New York Times, Exhibit No. 6, in that the white spots along the
right leg between the ankle and the knee do not appear in the reproduction in
the Journal-American. It very closely corresponds to the reproduction on the
front of the Life magazine, which is Shaneyfelt Exhibit No. 2. In fact, the
retouching appears to be very nearly the same. The lack of detail in the Newspaper
reproduction on Exhibit No. 7 precludes positively saying that it is identical,
but it is my feeling that it is probably identical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you point out some of the similarities in retouching?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; the retouching along the top of the rifle stock, the retouching
around the right shoulder and around the head, to the right of Oswald's
head, the retouching around the top of the rifle above the left hand, the elimination
of the shadow between the legs just below the breech of the trousers are
the same in both reproductions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there any notable difference between those reproductions,
the Life and Journal-American reproductions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. No; no notable difference in the retouching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have any opinion as to the source of the Journal-American
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; it is not possible to positively state, but I note in examining
the Journal-American reproduction, which is Exhibit No. 7, that the face
area in particular has a design in the light shadow areas which I recognized as
being typical of a halftone reproduction made from another halftone reproduction.
And because of the presence of this characteristic in the shadow area of
the face, and the manner in which the photograph is cropped or trimmed, I am of
the opinion that it is highly possible that the reproduction in the Journal-American,
Exhibit No. 7, was made from a Life magazine cover, issue of February
21, 1964, containing the reproduction of the photograph of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you elaborate on your statement that the cropping is
a factor in leading to this conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; on Exhibit No. 2, which is the Life magazine cover,
if a straight line is drawn vertically past the right edge of the Life sign on the
front of the magazine, so that the sign is blocked out, and that straight line is
continued through a shadow area comparable to the shadow in the reproduction
of Exhibit No. 7, the cropping along that edge of the photograph then becomes
identical to the cropping on the Journal-American photograph. This would
suggest that the picture was purposely cropped in that manner to eliminate the
Life magazine printing in the upper left-hand corner of the magazine cover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does the Life magazine picture, and also the Journal-American
picture, show cropping as against the original, that is, Exhibit No. 133-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes. The Life magazine photograph does not show all of
the photograph that appears on Commission Exhibit No. 133-A, the photograph
having been cropped down closer to the head, cutting out some of the overhead
area. There has also been considerable cropping on both the right and left
margins, when you compare the Life magazine and Journal-American reproductions
with Exhibit No. 133-A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there any other feature on the Journal-American photograph
which leads you to conclude that it was taken from the Life photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Yes; in the lower right-hand corner of the Life magazine
cover, Exhibit No. 2, there is a strip set in, containing the printing "February
21, 1964, 25 cents." If the Journal-American did, in fact, reproduce this picture
from a Life cover, it would have been necessary for them to retouch out this
strip of printing in the lower right-hand corner of the Life magazine cover, and
I find on examination of the reproduction on the Journal-American that there
is retouching in this area. The background of the grass is inconsistent, in that
it has been darkened around that area, and there is also darkening along the
foot and leg, and the shadow area has been altered in between the two feet
in a manner to strongly suggest that this strip has been retouched out in order
to make the reproduction on the Journal-American, Exhibit No. 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Shaneyfelt, do you have anything to add to your
testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, thank you very much then. That will be all.</p>

<h2 id="t418">TESTIMONY OF JAMES C. CADIGAN</h2>

<p>The testimony of James C. Cadigan was taken at 3:45 p.m., on April 30, 1964,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Mr. Melvin Aron Eisenberg,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">(The oath was administered by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, the purpose for which we are here is to go into
the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy, and in particular we have
asked you to testify concerning analysis of questioned documents. Mr. Cadigan,
could you state your full name and your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. James C. Cadigan. I am a special agent of the FBI, assigned
as an examiner of questioned documents in the FBI laboratory in Washington,
D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And how long have you been in this field, Mr. Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Twenty-three and one-half years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your training in this field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Upon being assigned to the laboratory I was given a specialized
course of training and instruction which consisted of attending various lectures
and conferences on the subject, reading books, and working under the direction of
experienced examiners.</p>

<p>Upon attaining a required degree of proficiency, I was assigned cases on my
own responsibility, and since that time I have examined many thousands of
cases involving handwriting, hand printing, typewriting, forgeries, erasures,
alterations, mechanical devices of all types, pens, paper, and ink. I conduct
research on various problems as they arise and assist in the training of our
new examiners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you testified in Federal or other courts, Mr. Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; in many Federal and State courts, and military courts-martial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 773,
and I ask you whether you have examined that item.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, that consists of an application to purchase a
rifle, addressed to Klein's Sporting Goods in Chicago. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand
you an item consisting of a roll of microfilm labeled D-77, and ask you whether
you are familiar with that roll of microfilm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That microfilm will be marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 1.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, was Exhibit No. 773 developed from a negative
contained in Cadigan Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; it was printed from that roll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 780, consisting of
the Marine Corps file of Lee Harvey Oswald; Commission Exhibit No. 778, consisting
of two letters extracted from Oswald's State Department file; Commission
Exhibit No. 781, consisting of a passport application by Lee Harvey Oswald,
dated June 25, 1963&mdash;at least "Passport Issued June 25, 1963"; and Cadigan
Exhibit No. 2, consisting of a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to John B.
Connally, then Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 2.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. This is in two parts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In two parts, and the second part consists of a letter from
Lee Harvey Oswald to a Brigadier General R. McC. Tompkins, dated 7 March
1962, and a group of documents, comprising photographs of the balance of Lee
Harvey Oswald's State Department file, labeled Cadigan Exhibit No. 3.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 3.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I ask you whether you have examined these various items.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, can you explain the meaning of the term
standard or "known documents" as used in the field of questioned-document
examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes. Known standards are samples of writings of an individual
which are known to be in his writing and which are available for comparison
with questioned or suspect writings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You have examined certain questioned writings allegedly prepared
by Lee Harvey Oswald, have you, Mr. Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In your examination, what documents did you use as known
documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Cadigan Exhibit No. 2, Commission Exhibit No. 781, Commission
Exhibit No. 778, Cadigan Exhibit No. 3, and Commission Exhibit No.
780.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, during the balance of the examination I will
refer to these documents collectively as the known or standard writings. Mr.
Cadigan, a portion of the known documents and a portion of the questioned
documents are photographs rather than originals; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are you able to identify the handwriting of an individual
on the basis of a photograph of that handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you make an identification, such an identification, if
your only questioned document was a photograph if the photograph was sufficiently
clear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. If the photograph is sufficiently clear, it is adequate for the
handwriting comparison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Similarly with standards, if your only standard was a photograph
or your only standards were photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. If your standards were also photographs, it is possible to make
the comparison and arrive at a definite opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And were the photographs in this case, both the standard
and the questioned documents, clear enough to form the basis of an opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes. I might point out that some of the known standards are
original documents and not photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; I am aware of that, but I wanted to set out on the record
whether the standards which are photographs are <span class="locked">adequate&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. They are adequate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. To serve as standards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Returning to Commission Exhibit No. 773, did you compare
the handwriting on that exhibit with the writing in the known standards to see
if they were written by the same person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That the writer of the known standards, Lee Harvey Oswald,
prepared the handwriting and hand printing on Commission Exhibit No. 773.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you prepared photographs or charts which you could
use to demonstrate the reason for that, Mr. Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Will you produce them? You are handing me an enlarged
photograph of Commission Exhibit No. 773, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This was prepared by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And constitutes an accurate photograph of Exhibit No. 773?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A.)</p>

<p>And have you prepared photographs of the standards, Mr. Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The first photograph is an enlargement of the letter to Brigadier
General R. McC. Tompkins? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 4.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 4.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the second photograph is an enlargement of a letter from
the State Department file, is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Enlargement of a letter in the State Department file.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In the State Department file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 5.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 5.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The third is an enlargement of a second letter in the State
Department file, the first letter having been dated "Received November 1, 1962,"
and this letter dated "December 7, 1962, Received December 11, 1962," is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 6.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 6.)</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Next is a letter to the State Department without an apparent
date, beginning, "Dear Sirs: Please forward receipts to me for final payment
of my loan" and so forth, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 7.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 7.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Next is another letter from the State Department file, reading,
Dear Sirs, please add this $10.00 to my account No. 38210 dated October 8.
Is that also from the State Department file, Mr. Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 8.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 8.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Next is the letter to then Secretary of the Navy John B. Connally
and a page from the letter to Brigadier General R. McC. Tompkins, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 9.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 9.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is in two parts, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; it is two pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Next is a photograph of the passport application referred to
earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 10.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 10.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And, finally, a photograph of the reverse side of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which will also be Cadigan Exhibit No. 10.</p>

<p>Now, in each case, Mr. Cadigan, were these photographs prepared by you or
under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. They were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And are they accurate photographs of the items described as
being the subject of the photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. They are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cadigan, with reference to your enlargement, Cadigan
Exhibit No. 3-A, and your photographs of standards, Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4
through 10, could you state some of the reasons which led you to the conclusion
that Commission Exhibit No. 778, of which Cadigan Exhibit No. 3 is an enlargement,
is in the writing of Lee Harvey Oswald, the author of the known documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; on Commission <span class="locked">Exhibit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You can refer to your photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. The enlarged photograph, Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A, contains both
handwriting and hand printing which was compared with the known standards,
Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10. I compared both the handwriting and the
hand printing to determine whether or not the same combination of individual
handwriting characteristics was present in both the questioned and the known
documents. I found many characteristics, some of which I would point out.</p>

<p>On the order blank, in the "A. Hidell" and in the wording "Dallas Texas"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
which constitutes a part of the return address, the letter "A" in Cadigan Exhibit
No. 3 is made in the same manner as the capital letter "A" on Cadigan Exhibit
No. 10. The letter is formed with a short straight stroke beginning about halfway
up the left side. The top of it is peaked or pointed. The right side is
straight, and is shorter than the initial stroke. The capital letter "D" in Dallas
is characterized by a staff or downstroke slanting at about a 30° angle.
The lower loop in some instances is closed. In the word "Dallas" the loop is
closed, and the body of the letter ends in a rounded loop formation. The same
characteristic I found in Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4, 5, and 6 as well as other
exhibits. The word "Texas" on Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A is characterized with the
letter "x" made in an unusual manner in that the writer, after completing the
body of the letter, makes an abrupt change of motion to the following letter "a."
This same characteristic I observed in the known standard on Cadigan Exhibits
Nos. 6, 9, and 4.</p>

<p>In the address portion of the envelope, Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A, appears the
word "Dept." I noticed here, again, the same formation of the capital "D."
In addition, the entire word "Dept" appears in the known standards on Cadigan
Exhibits Nos. 5, 6, and 7. The characteristics I would point out here are in the
letter "p" in Cadigan Exhibit No. 3, where the letter is made with a relatively
long narrow staff, and the body of the letter is a rounded shape which projects
above the staff. The letter "t" ends abruptly in a downstroke. In the handprinting
appearing in the exhibit marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A, the wording
"Dallas, Texas" contains a number of the same characteristics as Cadigan
Exhibit No. 5, where the same wording appears, and on Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 7
and 8. The writer uses a script-type "D," and prints the other letters in the
word "Dallas." The "A" again is made in a similar way to the "A" in "A. Hidell,"
with a beginning of the downstroke approximately three-quarters of the way up
the left side of the stroke. The letter is relatively narrow, and the right-hand
side of the letter is straight. In the double "L" combinations there is a curve
in the lower portion of the letter. The "S" has a flat top, slanting at approximately
a 30-degree angle. In the word "Texas" in Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A the
writer has used a small "e" following the letter "T." The same characteristics
will be noted on Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 5, 7, and 8.</p>

<p>Additionally, I noted that in addition to the shape of the letters themselves,
the relative heights of the letters, the spacing between the letters, the slant of
the letters in both the know and questioned documents are the same.</p>

<p>On Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A, in the portion for address, appears the notation
"P.O. Box 2915," and this same wording appears on Cadigan Exhibit No. 5, and
on No. 7 and No. 8 except for the "P.O." portion. Here, again, I observed the
same formation of the individual letters; the spacing, the style, the slant of the
writings in both questioned and known were observed to be the same.</p>

<p>The tail of the "5" is made with a relatively long stroke and the same characteristic
appears in the known standards. In the hand printed name "A.
Hidell," on Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A, another characteristic I noted was the very
small-sized "i" in the name "Hidell." The writer makes this letter very short in
contrast to the other letters in the name. This same characteristic I observed
on Cadigan Exhibit No. 10, the passport application. With reference to the "i"
dot on Cadigan Exhibit No. 3 in the name "Hidell," in the return portion, the
dot is relatively high and between the body of the letter and the following letter
"d." In the portion of the word "Chicago"&mdash;of the name "Chicago"&mdash;in the
address portion on Cadigan Exhibit No. 3, the "i" dot is between the "o" and the
"g" in "Chicago" and is well above the line of writing. On Cadigan Exhibit
No. 4 I observed the same displacement of the "i" dot. In some instances, it is
slightly to the right of the body of the letter, as in the word "citizenship" in the
sixth line from the bottom, whereas in the word "direct" in the ninth line from
the bottom the "i" dot is displaced one and a half letters to the right.</p>

<p>Based upon the combination of these individual characteristics which
I have pointed out, as well as others, I reached the opinion that the handwriting
and handprinting on Cadigan Exhibit No. 3-A were written by Lee Harvey
Oswald, the writer of the known standards, Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cadigan, the photographs which comprise Cadigan
Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10 are actually somewhat more limited than the standards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
in that they represent in some cases excerpts from the standards, is that
correct? Such as excerpts from the Marine Corps file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, when you refer to the standards, Cadigan Exhibits Nos.
4 through 10, do you mean by that that you based your conclusion only on the
excerpts shown in Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; the exhibits, Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10, were
merely prepared for demonstration purposes. The original examination and
comparison was made using all of the writings, the handwriting and handprinting
in the State Department file, the Marine Corps file, the passport application
and the two letters, one to Governor Connally and one to Brigadier
General Tompkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is, the documents which you identified very close to the
beginning of the deposition, and which I referred to collectively as the
standards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 788,
and ask you if you have examined that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, that is the money order which was included
with the purchase order to Klein's. Have you prepared a photograph of that
exhibit, Mr. Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 11.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 11.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And this was taken by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And is it an accurate photograph of the money order, Exhibit
No. 788?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you compare Exhibit No. 788 with the standards to determine
whether Exhibit No. 788 had been written by Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That the postal money order, Cadigan Exhibit No. 11, had been
prepared by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The postal money order is Commission Exhibit No. 788 and
your picture is Cadigan Exhibit No. 11, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you explain some of the points of identity which led
you to the conclusion that you formed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I think that using the wording "Dallas, Texas" appearing
on Commission Exhibit No. 839 as an example of some of the handwriting
characteristics present on this <span class="locked">exhibit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You mean Cadigan Exhibit No. 11?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes. In the wording "Dallas, Texas," the writing is quite
characteristic. I noted, again, the overall size, spacing, slant, and relative proportions
of letters on Cadigan Exhibit No. 11 were the same as on Cadigan
Exhibit No. 6, and that the letter "D" was characterized on Cadigan Exhibit No.
11 with a relatively short staff, with a rather long retrace on the left side of the
staff, the body of the letter ending in a large curling stroke. The small letter "a"
is rather narrow and somewhat flat. There is a rather long smooth connecting
stroke between the "a" and the double letter "l." The "s" is almost triangular
in shape, and has no ending stroke or tail to the right.</p>

<p>Further, on Cadigan Exhibit No. 11, in the word "Texas" I noted again the
rather unusual shape of the small letter "x," in that it appears almost as though
it were a letter "u." The capital letter "T" in "Texas" has a very long curved
beginning stroke and a small eyelet or loop in the lower portion of the letter.</p>

<p>I noted these same characteristics on Cadigan Exhibit No. 6 in the wording
Dallas, Texas, and certain of the letters on Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 6, 7, 8, and
the entire word "Texas" in Cadigan Exhibit No. 4.</p>

<p>I noted also, again, that the small letter "p" in the word "sporting" on Cadigan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
Exhibit No. 11 was made the same as the "p's" in the known standards as well
as on Cadigan Exhibit No. 3 in the word "Dept," in that the staff is long, in the
form of a long closed loop, and the upper portion of the letter extends above
the staff and the body of the letter is not closed to the staff.</p>

<p>I further noted that on Cadigan Exhibit No. 11 the wording "P.O. Box 2915"
contained the same characteristics as the same wording in Cadigan Exhibits Nos.
5, 6, and 7. And here again, based on a combination of personal handwriting
characteristics in the entire writing, I reached the opinion that Cadigan Exhibit
No. 11 had been written by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 135,
which, for the record, is an order used for the purchase of the revolver that was
apparently used to murder Officer Tippit, and I ask you whether you examined
that exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And have you taken a photograph of that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which you now have before you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have an enlarged photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that would be Cadigan Exhibit No. 12.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 12.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This was taken by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. It is an accurate photograph of Exhibit No. 135?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, did you compare Commission Exhibit No. 135
with the standard or known writings of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your conclusion as to the origin of 135?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That it was written by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And can you give some of the reasons that led you to form that
conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; here again, it is the presence of the same combination of
individual handwriting characteristics, both handwriting and handprinting.
For example, again the wording "Dallas, Texas," is handprinted on Cadigan
Exhibit No. 12, and the same characteristics appear in the same wording on
Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 9, 7, 6, and 8. The formation of the individual letters
on Cadigan Exhibit No. 12, the spacing of the letters, the proportions of the
letters, were found to be the same as on the known standards.</p>

<p>Additionally, the capital letter "D" in the name "Drittal" on Cadigan Exhibit
No. 12 has a rather unusual appearance in the upper portion of the letter in that
it is very pointed and wedge-shaped, and I found this same shape present on the
reverse side of the passport application on Cadigan Exhibit No. 10, page 2
in the word "Dec."</p>

<p>Again, I noted the rather long tail or ending stroke on the number "5" in the
address portion of this exhibit. Again, based on finding the same combination
of individual handwriting habits in the questioned and known writings, I
concluded that Commission Exhibit No. 135 was written by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 791, which,
for the record, is an application by Oswald for post office box 2915, dated October
9, 1962, and ask you whether you have examined that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And have you prepared a photograph of that exhibit, Mr.
Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 13.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 13.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was this prepared by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And is it a true and accurate photograph of 791?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you attempt to determine whether Commission Exhibit
No. 791 had been prepared by the author of the standards, Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That Lee Harvey Oswald had prepared the hand printing, signature,
and date on Commission Exhibit No. 791. This excludes the box number
and the wording "Dallas, Tex.," in the lower right portion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give some of the reasons why you came to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; the reasons are basically the same, the presence of the same
combination of both handwritten and hand printed characteristics in the known
and questioned exhibits. On Cadigan Exhibit No. 18 we have the hand printed
<span class="locked">wording&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Cadigan Exhibit No. 18?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Cadigan Exhibit No. 10, excuse me, the passport application,
we have the wording "LEE OSWALD." This hand printed signature is quite distinctive
in the formation of the individual letters, in the spacing of the letters,
and their slant. For example, the letter "L" on both Cadigan Exhibit No. 13
and on Cadigan Exhibit No. 10, there is a small hook in the upper left portion
where the downstroke begins, and there is a little tent or hill at the base of the
letter. The double letter "E's" also have a curve, a dent at the base of the
letter, although not so pronounced. Both letters, both letter "E's," are approximately
the same height as the "L."</p>

<p>In the last name "OSWALD" on Cadigan Exhibit No. 13 and on Cadigan
Exhibit No. 10 the "O" has a pointed or tented appearance in the upper right
portion, and the ending stroke curves down into the body of the letter. The "S"
and "W" in both the questioned and known are smaller than the following
capital letter "A." This capital letter "A" in both instances is made in the
same manner as previously described on other exhibits. The writer uses a
lower-case or small "l," and a lower-case or small "d" for the last two letters of
his name, the "d" portion or the letter "d" in both instances being made with a
straight-slanted stroke, then an abrupt circular stroke to the left.</p>

<p>In addition on this same exhibit I noted the formation of the letter "i." The
exhibit I refer to is Cadigan Exhibit No. 13&mdash;the "i" being made very small in
relation to the other letters adjacent to it.</p>

<p>This document also bears the signature "Lee H. Oswald" which, again, is a
very characteristic signature. It appears in Cadigan Exhibit No. 13, the questioned
document, and Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The signature
I noted was written rather rapidly. It is somewhat distorted in appearance.
The initial "L" has a rather long curved beginning stroke and relatively narrow
upper and lower portions of the letter. The letter "H" is made with two parallel
strokes and it can be seen that there is a very little retrace from the base of
the first stroke in the letter to the top of the second stroke in the letter.</p>

<p>The "O" combination is rather unusual in that the writer swings into the
letter "s" from the top of the "O." Also, as the signature progresses to the right
it increases in size, and very noticeably in the "ld" portion where the "d"
stands well above the line of writing. And in this particular signature there is a
long-swinging stroke from the top of the "d," having a shape similar to a "u"
lying on its side. The base of the letter has a very sharp angular formation.</p>

<p>Again, based on a combination of the same individual handwriting and hand
printing characteristics, I reached the opinion that Commission Exhibit No. 791
was prepared by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 793,
consisting of a change-of-address card relating to box 2915. Have you examined
that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And have you prepared a photograph thereof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 14.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 14.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This photograph is an accurate reproduction of Commission
Exhibit No. 793?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, getting back for a moment to Cadigan Exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
No. 13, I see that there is another picture shown on that exhibit, apart from the
one as to which you testified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes. That is a Post Office Department Form 1093, application
for post office box, and the post office box number is 6225, and it is signed,
Lee H. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And why is that included on the picture with Cadigan Exhibit
No. 13, or rather on the picture with Commission Exhibit No. 791? Is
that because they were both <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; it is part of another post office application that does not
relate to box 2916.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you have any particular reason for printing that up with
the photograph of Exhibit No. 791?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No. I think it may have been part of another exhibit which
has not as yet been introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does your identification of Exhibit No. 791 in any way depend
upon that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So we can disregard it for our purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. If you want to, I can take it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, it is in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I mean I can just cut it along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I would rather leave it in, since it is in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I just wanted to make sure that it didn't need to be discussed
as part of the identification of Exhibit No. 791, and I take it it does not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, getting back to Commission Exhibit No. 793 and the
photograph thereof, which is Cadigan Exhibit No. 14, did you attempt to determine
whether Commission Exhibit No. 793 had been prepared by Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The photograph of which is Cadigan Exhibit No. 14. And
what was your conclusion on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Again, that Commission Exhibit No. 793 was written by Lee
Harvey Oswald, again based upon finding the same combination of individual
handwriting and hand printing characteristics in both the questioned writing
and the known standards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you discuss some of those common characteristics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes. Here, again, the entire word "Dallas" and the word
Texas is made in a very characteristic manner which I have described before,
and which appears on Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 9, 6, 7, and 8.</p>

<p>The signature "Lee H. Oswald" was found to have the same characteristics
as the known signatures, although here I noted that in the ending "d" in
Oswald the stroke was less cursive than the ending "d" in Cadigan Exhibit
No. 13, in that the writer makes a rather narrow loop and does not cross the
staff of the letter "d." I noted this characteristic, also, in Cadigan Exhibits
Nos. 9 and 10. I would like to point out that here, again, the writer varies his
individual characteristics, which is entirely normal and expected, and actually
it adds weight to the characteristic to find that it does vary to some degree. All
writing, particularly signatures, are never exactly duplicated and some variation
is normally expected, and finding the same variations in both questioned
and known signatures increases the value of it, so that, again, the presence
of the same combination of handwriting and hand printing characteristics in
Cadigan Exhibit No. 14 in the known exhibits enabled me to reach the opinion
that Commission Exhibit No. 793 was written by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You used the term "cursive" in respect to this. Can you
explain the meaning of that term?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; the ending "d" stroke is made with a flourish or a sweeping
motion on Cadigan Exhibit No. 13, and on Cadigan Exhibit No. 14 the
stroke ends abruptly at the staff of the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And why do you call one "more cursive"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Merely for description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain the meaning of the term "cursive" apart
from your use in this instance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I think cursive has also been used to describe the roundness of
writing as opposed to an angular shape. I think it also is sometimes used to
distinguish between handwriting and hand printing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now show you Commission Exhibit No. 795,
consisting of an item purporting to be a Selective Service System notice of
classification in the name of "Alek James Hidell"; Commission No. 801, a
Selective Service System notice of classification in the name of Lee Harvey
Oswald; Commission Exhibit No. 802, a registration certificate of the Selective
Service System in the name of Lee Harvey Oswald; Commission Exhibit
No. 803, a photographic negative; Commission Exhibit No. 804, a photograph
negative; Commission Exhibit No. 805, a photograph negative; and Commission
Exhibit No. 811, a photographic negative, and I ask you whether you have
examined these various items?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Based on that examination, Mr. Cadigan, could you discuss
your conclusions concerning Commission Exhibit No. 795?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes. Commission Exhibit No. 795 is a fraudulent and counterfeit
reproduction made from the retouched photographic negatives in Commission
Exhibits Nos. 804, 805, and 811 which in turn were made from Commission
Exhibits Nos. 801 and 802.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And how were they prepared precisely, Mr. Cadigan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. These are photographic reproductions. What was done was to
take a genuine Selective Service System notice of classification, Commission
Exhibit No. 801 in the name of Lee Harvey Oswald. From this, a photographic
negative was prepared. Then various portions of the information, including
the name, the selective service number, the signature of the clerk of the local
board were obliterated with a red opaque substance, and I noted that in the
course of this the individual preparing the negative had inadvertently cut off
portions of the printed letters, had thickened printed lines, and especially I
noted in the signature portion had destroyed portions of the printed letters,
and I compared the Commission Exhibit No. 795 with the retouched negative
itself, and observed that the defects in the Commission Exhibit No. 795 were
due to the retouching of the negative. Although the negative has been blotted
out, or the information has been blotted out, it is readily visible to the naked eye
that on Commission Exhibit No. 893, which was also examined in connection
with the examination of Commission Exhibit No. 795, the original writing, the
original signature and the typed information "Lee Harvey Oswald" and selective
service number is the same as it appears on Commission Exhibit No. 801.
The opaquing is merely to remove this information photographically. There
was an intervening step where a small negative or a reduced negative of the
lower portion of the face of the card which refers to the penalty for violation
concerning carrying the card itself was made. The individual responsible made
a reduced photograph but, again, the same characteristics are apparent, and by
comparing the print, the photographic print Commission Exhibit No. 795 with
these negatives, it is possible to determine that the Commission Exhibit No. 795
was produced from the negatives and the negatives in turn were produced from
Commission Exhibits Nos. 801 and 802.</p>

<p>In this connection, I would point out that the reverse side of Commission
Exhibit 795 is the form used for a registration certificate, and it is not a proper
face of a notice of classification. Here, again, the same procedure was followed.
The original card is photographed. The unwanted information is painted out
with an opaque substance, and then a photographic print is prepared. Then
the individual responsible typed in the information "Alek James Hidell" with the
selective service number, descriptive data on the reverse, and the number of the
local board.</p>

<p>Further, an examination of the Commission Exhibit No. 795 shows the individual
had placed the photograph in a typewriter and struck a number of keys
which did not print. The indentations from the typewriter keys can be clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
seen in side lighting. Also, in the selective service number on the face of the
card and the data on the back of the card, indentations of typewriter keys
were noted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, returning to the negatives, I see that in Commission
Exhibit No. 803, as you pointed out, the information that was originally
on the card is visible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Whereas, in Commission Exhibit No. 894 it is not visible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain the difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; because Commission Exhibit No. 804 is an intermediate
step. Commission Exhibit No. 803 was first prepared, and a print was made
from this exhibit. The photographic print would not have the name "Lee
Harvey Oswald" in red on it. In the place of "Lee Harvey Oswald" it would
show as a blank. Then using the print, a second negative is prepared, and
further retouching is done, and also the warning notice in a reduced form is
inserted into the negative, so that the data from the original notice of classification
issued in the name of Oswald appears on the first negative and does not
appear on the second negative, but both negatives are directly linked to the
original card of Oswald and to the counterfeit reproduction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, have you prepared photographs of this card showing
some of the details you have been discussing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be Cadigan Exhibit No. 15.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 15.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This Cadigan <span class="locked">Exhibit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Actually, there are four different photographs, photographic enlargements
that comprise Cadigan Exhibit No. 15, the face and reverse of the
notice of classification made in normal lighting, and the face and reverse of
the card made with side lighting showing the typewritten indentations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Let's mark those, then, Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 15, 16, and 17,
and 18.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 15, 18, 17,
and 18.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Cadigan Exhibit No. 15 shows the face with normal
lighting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Cadigan Exhibit No. 16 shows the reverse with normal
lighting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Cadigan Exhibit No. 17 shows the face with side lighting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And Cadigan Exhibit No. 18 shows the reverse with side
lighting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. These exhibits also contain pictures of another questioned document
which we will get to shortly, and that is the certificate of service in the
name of Alek James Hidell, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, starting with Cadigan Exhibit No. 15, could you discuss
several of the features on which you base the conclusions you have given us
earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes. The observation of this exhibit will show in the blocks for
the selective service number fragmentary portions of the original selective service
number. The lines have been thickened. In the space provided for "been classified
in Class," in the middle, in approximately the middle of the space there is
a heavy dotted line. By comparing this with the original card issued in the
name "Oswald" is seen the lower portion of the capital letter "I."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you taken a photograph of the original card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That we will mark Cadigan Exhibit No. 19.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 19.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. On the right-hand side of the card the word "President" appears,
and on Cadigan Exhibit No. 15 a portion of the "r" and the "e" is missing, due
to the retouching. Examination of the corresponding area on Cadigan Exhibit
No. 19 shows that this was due to retouching a portion of the signature of the
local board. Similarly, in the wording "heavy penalty for violation" appearing
below the signature, the word "violation" is considerably distorted in that portions
of the various letters are missing. The negative shows this is due to retouching,
and a comparison with the original card of Oswald, of which Cadigan
Exhibit No. 19 is an enlargement, shows where the lower loops of the letter "f"
cut into the letter, cut into the printed word "violation," which required retouching
by the individual to remove it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you taken photographs of these negatives to illustrate
these points?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This is that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 20.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 20.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. And by referring to the Cadigan Exhibit No. 20, which shows
the retouching, examination of the area in the word "President" will show where
the portion of the "r" has been cut off. It will show where the capital letter "I"
appears in the space provided "been classified in Class," the "I" being part of
the classification, Roman numeral "IV-A," which appears on the original card.</p>

<p>Cadigan Exhibit No. 20 shows, also, the intermediate negative where the size
of the warning appearing on the bottom of the card was reduced, and the additional
retouching made that causes the distorted appearance of the word "violation"
on the Commission Exhibit No. 795, so that it was based on my comparison
side by side of the negatives, the photographic print, and the original exhibit
in the wallet of Oswald, which enabled me to determine that this Commission
Exhibit No. 795 was a fraudulent counterfeit made from retouched negatives
which, in turn, were made from the original exhibits, Commission Exhibits Nos.
801 and 802.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I think that Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 16, 17, and 18 are self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. They merely serve to illustrate the indented typewriting that
appears on these exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 806,
purporting to be a certificate of service that Alek James Hidell has honorably
served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps, and ask you whether you have
examined that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 812, consisting of two
negatives. Have you examined those negatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Based upon your examination, have you come to any conclusion
as to the construction of Commission Exhibit No. 806?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; again, this is a fraudulent and counterfeit reproduction
made from photographic negatives which, in turn, were made from the original
card issued in the name of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you taken a photograph of the original card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And where does that appear? That is the photograph you are
handing me now, which we will label Cadigan Exhibit No. 21?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 21.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Cadigan Exhibit No. 21 includes the selective service registration
certificate we have been discussing, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; it includes an enlargement of the original Selective Service
System registration certificate issued in the name of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that is the Selective Service System certificate on which
the forgery in the name of Hidell was based?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. From which the reverse side of the forged or the fraudulent and
counterfeit notice of classification was prepared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Focusing our attention on the certificate of service, could you
illustrate by use of this photograph and any others you have already introduced
some of the points which led you to your <span class="locked">conclusion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As to Commission Exhibit No. 806?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. The two negatives in Commission Exhibit No. 812, which appear
on Cadigan Exhibit No. 20, show the areas of retouching. Examination of the
negatives themselves in Commission Exhibit No. 812 shows that the original
entries on the face and reverse side can be seen. It appears in red. The face
reads "Lee Harvey Oswald, 1653230." And the reverse side bears his signature.</p>

<p>From a study of the negatives and from the enlarged photographs, Cadigan
Exhibits Nos. 15, 16, 17, and 18, I wish to point out some of the evidence that
links these three items together. On Cadigan Exhibit No. 16, on the reverse
side in the printed word "signature," the "u" is misshapen, due to some of the
retouched substance crossing the letter, and this is exactly in the area where the
upper portion of the name "Lee" appears on the original card. This is seen
on Cadigan Exhibit No. 21.</p>

<p>Also on the line below, in which appears the printed wording "signature of
certifying officer," in the letter "n" in "certifying" can be seen a long line
which at first glance might appear to be a part of the signature "A.&nbsp;G. Ayers,
Jr.," but which corresponds exactly to the ending stroke of the letter "y"
in "Harvey."</p>

<p>Also, in the printed word "officer" on the same line can be seen the effects
of the retouch in that the upper part of the first "f" has been cut off by the
retouch substance. So that by a study and a comparison of the Commission
Exhibit No. 806 with the negatives, with particular reference to where the
retouching fluid has cut into lines or printing, and further comparing the
same negative with the original card, as shown in Cadigan Exhibit No. 21, I
determined and it can be seen that the Commission Exhibit No. 806 was
produced from the negatives in Exhibit No. 812, which, in turn, were produced
from the original card of which Cadigan Exhibit No. 21 is a photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, in either the fraudulent selective service notice
of classification or certificate of service, have attempts been made to reinstate
portions of printed lines which were blocked out by the opaque substance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; I didn't notice that, particularly. I noticed from a technical
standpoint that the opaquing was rather crudely done, in that the opaquing of
negatives is a common photographic technique, and with reasonable care you
can avoid cutting into lines. I didn't particularly observe any areas where
the lines had been put back in.</p>

<p>This does not eliminate the possibility, because it is a very simple matter of
scratching through the opaque emulsion to produce such a line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Where the line is thickened, as is visible in Cadigan Exhibit
No. 15, how would you account for that, Mr. Cadigan? I am looking now at
Cadigan Exhibit No. 15 in the block, that portion of the rectangular block surrounding
the number "224," and particularly the bottom of the block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. A study and examination of Cadigan Exhibit No. 19 shows that
these areas correspond to the figures "114" which appear in the second block
of the Selective Service number, and which were not retouched off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So you feel that, rather than the bottom of that block being
thickened in the retouching, what you have is a residue from the typed-in
<span class="locked">portion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which appeared on the original card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; and this can be further seen. The right-hand side of the
block for the first two letters of the selective service number shows a thickened
area which corresponds to the numeral "1" on the original card of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, returning now for a moment to Commission Exhibit
No. 795, were you able to identify either of the two signatures written in
ink on that card, the one being "Alek J. Hidell," and the other a signature written
over the caption "Member or clerk of local board"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; I did examine the "Alek J. Hidell" signature appearing as
the signature of registrant, but the known writings available of Lee Harvey
Oswald were not sufficiently comparable with the signature to reach a definite
opinion. I did note, however, some similarities in the letter "A" and in the last
name, the letter "H" and the ending "l." But these were not of sufficient weight
nor of sufficient number nor of sufficient combination to warrant a definite
opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You say you compared this item, this signature with the known
standards. Did you compare the signature with questioned documents which
you already identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I wonder whether after this deposition would
you compare this signature with those questioned signatures of "Alek J. Hidell"
which you have now identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 817,
consisting of a portion of an application for a post office box 30061 in New
Orleans, POD Form 1093, and ask you whether you have examined that item?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And have you attempted to determine whether that item,
Commission Exhibit No. 817, was prepared by Lee Harvey Oswald, whose known
writings we have introduced previously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. On Commission Exhibit No. 817 the hand printed names, "A.&nbsp;J.
Hidell," and "Marina Oswald," and the signature "L.&nbsp;H. Oswald," were written
by Lee Harvey Oswald, based on a comparison with his known standards of
writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you prepared a photograph of Commission Exhibit
No. 817?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And does that also include a photograph of another item,
apparently another part of the application?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did your identification of the Commission Exhibit No. 817
depend in any way upon your identification of the other part of the item which
is shown in your photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. It did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I will mark the photograph Cadigan. Exhibit No. 22.
(The document referred to was marked Cadigan Exhibit No. 22.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was this prepared by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And it is an accurate photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. We haven't been going over that with all the other photographs,
but is that true of all the photographs we have introduced so far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And any other photographs you may introduce during the
balance of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, by use of that photograph and by use of the
photographs of the standards, could you explain some of the points which led
you to your conclusion concerning Commission Exhibit No. 817?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; here again, it is the presence of the same combination of
characteristics in the hand printing and signature on Cadigan Exhibit No. 22
and on Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10. For example, the word "Marina"
on Cadigan Exhibit No. 22 can be compared with the same word or the same
name on Cadigan Exhibit No. 10, the "M" being characterized by a rather long
beginning stroke, the center of the letter is high, giving the letter somewhat
the appearance of the numeral "3" tipped on its side. The "A" is similar to or
made in the same way as previous "A's," with a pointed top, with the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
stroke about two-thirds of the way up the staff. The "i", again, is very small
in relation to the letters coming before and after it. In the "N" there is a curve
at the base of the letter. It is more pronounced on Cadigan Exhibit No. 22 than
in the name "Marina" in Cadigan Exhibit No. 10, but in the name "Lillian," on
the same exhibit, the same kind of curve is observed.</p>

<p>In "Oswald," again in the signature "L.&nbsp;H. Oswald," I find the same characteristics
and combinations of characteristics. In the questioned signature in
Cadigan Exhibit No. 22 as in the various known signatures in Cadigan
Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10, here I think the ending "ld," the narrow pointed
loops used for the "l" and "d" are very small, and with a rather misshapen body
or upper stroke.</p>

<p>Again, it is the presence of the same combination of handwriting and hand
printing characteristics which led me to the opinion that this exhibit had been
prepared by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 813,
a vaccination certificate, a purported vaccination certificate, signed by "A.&nbsp;J.
Hidell," and I ask you whether you have examined that item?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, this bears writing on the outside and the inside. Have
you attempted to determine whether that writing is the writing of Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That the hand printing and the Oswald signature were written
by Lee Harvey Oswald, again based on the presence of the same combination
of individual handwriting and hand printing characteristics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you taken photographs of this exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Those will be Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 23 and 24.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 23 and 24.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I would point out that these represent only a portion of the
original document, since for demonstration purposes the lower printed blank is
not included in these exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, the document as we see it now exhibits extremely faint
writing. Can you explain the reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; this is due to treatment of the card for latent fingerprints
by chemical process which bleaches and makes inks run.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was the document treated to restore the original color after
it had been treated for fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; from looking at this, it has been desilvered, but it has not
been completely desilvered since parts of the stains of the chemical treatment
remain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you first saw the document and made your examination,
was the document in its original condition, that is, had it been treated yet for
fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I never saw the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You never saw the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; I had a Xerox copy of the original exhibit. I did not see
this original exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You said before you had examined this exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. To be more exact, I examined a Xerox copy of this exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you know who prepared the Xerox copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. It was submitted by our Dallas office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was this a copy of the front and the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And are your photographs of the Xerox or of the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. They are made from the Xerox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is this the first time you saw the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Based upon your examination of the original at this point,
and a comparison of the photograph of the Xerox copies, would you conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
that the Xerox copies had been made before the document had been treated for
fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Very definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you note a few of the points which led you to your
conclusion concerning the handwriting appearing on the documents you photographed
as Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 23 and 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; the handwritten signature "Lee H. Oswald" is written in
a very distinctive manner. The "L" with its rather long beginning stroke, and
its narrow upper, and the lower loop, is almost in the shape of a triangle. The
large loop formation at the top of the "O" leading into the letter "s" and the
loop at the base of the "s" is almost a carbon copy of the same characteristic
appearing on Cadigan Exhibit No. 10, page 2. And again, the narrow "l" and
relatively large "d" with a very pronounced ending stroke on the "d" is typical
of the manner in which this man writes his signature.</p>

<p>So also in the hand printing, on Cadigan Exhibit No. 10, we see the "LEE"
and the "OSWALD," the little hook at the start of the "L" and the reverse
curves at the base of both the "L" and the following "EE's." Again, we see
the use of the lowercase "l" and the lowercase "d" in the formation of "Oswald,"
whereas the rest of the letters are capital letters.</p>

<p>Here, again, the presence of the same combination of characteristics led me
to the opinion that this writing had been prepared by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does that include the signature "A.&nbsp;J. Hidell"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; it does not. This signature is distorted, and the standards,
the known standards of Lee Harvey Oswald I had available for comparison
would not justify any opinion concerning this particular signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you attempt to compare it with the questioned items which
you had, theretofore, identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; without reaching any opinion one way or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you conclude that it was not written by Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; I would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does it bear any similarities to Oswald's handwriting at any
point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I didn't observe any that I thought were sufficiently significant
in characteristics to warrant pointing out. It is a question of judgment as to
how you evaluate a given characteristic. I don't see, and do not see now, any
characteristic worthy of mention to either say Oswald did or didn't do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 115, consisting of a rubber
stamping kit, and ask you whether you have examined that stamping kit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you attempt to determine whether the stamping on the
document which you have photographed as Cadigan Exhibit No. 23, was produced
by the rubber stamp kit, Exhibit No. 115?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What conclusion did you reach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I couldn't reach any conclusion because the exhibit that I had,
and from which Cadigan Exhibit No. 23 was made, is a Xerox copy, and is not
adequate for the rubber stamp examination of this kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you see anything which led you to believe that the stamp
on on the document you examined could not have been made by Exhibit
No. 115?</p>

<p>Rather than answer that question, could you undertake to perform an examination
based upon the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. At a subsequent time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you will supply us with the results of that by letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 819, consisting of a
photograph of a card, "Fair Play for Cuba Committee, New Orleans Chapter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
L.&nbsp;H. Oswald," with Oswald's signature, or a signature purporting to be Lee H.
Oswald's, and the signature "A.&nbsp;J. Hidell"; and Commission Exhibit No. 820,
which appears to be similar to the photograph Exhibit No. 819, except that there
is no signature apparent in the space where the signature A.&nbsp;J. Hidell appears in
Exhibit No 819, and I ask you whether you have examined these two items.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is Exhibit No. 819 a photograph of Exhibit No. 820?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Exhibit No. 820 is seriously discolored now and does not have
the words "A.&nbsp;J. Hidell" apparent. Can you explain how that came about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; the original Commission Exhibit No. 820 had been treated
for latent fingerprints, and this is a chemical process which has removed the ink
of the signature. However, on examination under strong side lighting and
using low-power magnification, portions of the letters "A," "J," and "H," of the
signature of the chapter president can be discerned, and are in the same place
on the photograph, Commission Exhibit No. 819, as on the original, Commission
Exhibit No. 820.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a comparison of the writing and the rubber stamp, especially
with reference to the position of these with respect to lines and printing and
other fixed points on the card, definitely shows that Commission Exhibit No. 819
is a photograph of Exhibit No. 820, and made before it was treated for latent
fingerprints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, apart from this, did you take the photograph, Exhibit
No. 819?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; the photograph was made in our photographic laboratory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But you did see Exhibit No. 820, before it had been discolored,
did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I don't recall at this time. It may well be that I did, but I have
no independent recollection of it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that your testimony that Exhibit No. 819 is a photograph of
Exhibit No. 820 is based upon your evaluation of the two items as they exist
now rather than upon recollection of Exhibit No. 820 before it was discolored?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you know why Exhibit No. 820 was not reprocessed or
desilvered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No, this is a latent fingerprint matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain why the signature, "Lee H. Oswald" or rather
L.&nbsp;H. Oswald is apparent, while the signature "A.&nbsp;J. Hidell" is not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Different inks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Some inks are more soluble in the solution used for fingerprint
tests than others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Other Commission Exhibits, specifically Nos. 788, 801, and
802 also appear to have been treated for fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Exhibit No. 788 has been desilvered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Desilvered, and Exhibits Nos. 801 and 802 are still in their
original silvered condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you see these items before they were treated for fingerprints?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I know I saw Exhibit No. 788 before it was treated for fingerprints.
As to Exhibits Nos. 801 and 802, I don't know at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are the photographs which you produced photographs of the
items before they were treated for fingerprints or after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; before they were treated for fingerprints. In other words,
it is regular customary practice to photograph an exhibit before it is treated
for latents for exactly this reason, that in the course of the treatment there may
be some loss of detail, either total or partial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take the photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are you referring to the photographs which you produced at
an earlier point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. The photographs that I have produced here today, the various
enlargements, were made from negatives. These negatives, in turn, were made
at the time the original exhibits were photographed, and this would be before
latent fingerprint treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I asked you when I introduced those exhibits whether they had
been prepared by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You meant, then, that they were prepared under your supervision,
or did you mean that they were prepared by you in the sense that you
made the enlargement from the negative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No; they were prepared under my supervision. In other words,
I maintain all of the negatives in connection with the document aspects of this
file in my room, under lock and key, at all times. I pull the negatives that I
want enlarged, and I prepare a photograph requisition, take it down to our
photographers, tell them what I want, and then later go back and pick up the
enlargements, and check them to be sure they are just what I want.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What about the negative itself? Can you state of your own
knowledge whether the negative itself is of the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Only, insofar, that I know that on November 23, when the vast
bulk of this material came in, that it was photographed. Some of these items
I saw before they were photographed, and some afterward. But the exact sequence
to select one item out of four or five hundred, I cannot, in all honesty,
say I definitely recall seeing this before it was photographed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain what the procedure is when a document came
in involving the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Initially, the first big batch of evidence was brought into the
laboratory on November 23 of 1963 and this consisted of many, many items.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. November 23, 1963. It was a very large quantity of evidence
that was brought in. There were several agent examiners available to evaluate
this material. There were supervisory officials, there were representatives from
our Internal Security Division, all of whom had an interest in this matter, and
it was decided they wanted certain items treated for latent fingerprints. The
basic rule is always that before an exhibit is treated for latent fingerprints it is
photographed, and that is what was done in this case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What happens to the negative after it is photographed?
Were they all given to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; the negatives that pertain to the document aspects I took
over and maintained under my control. Negatives pertaining to firearms evidence
or hairs or fibers, they were turned over to Mr. Frazier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So under the regular procedure, as soon as the document came
in it would be photographed, before it was treated for latents and the negative
would be turned over to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So at least if the procedure had been followed, any negative
you had would be a negative of a document before it had been treated for
fingerprints, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, returning to Commission Exhibits Nos. 820 and 819,
did you prepare a photograph which would show the remnants of the signature
A.&nbsp;J. Hidell on the Commission Exhibit No. 820?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is the preparation of such a photograph possible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I doubt it very much, because the indentations are so faint that
the enlargement would serve no useful purpose. Actually, the best examination
is by low-power magnification under the proper lighting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you attempt to determine whether the signature of Lee
H. Oswald on this card was written by Lee H. Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That the Lee H. Oswald signature on Commission Exhibit No.
820 was written by Lee H. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What about the signature "A.&nbsp;J. Hidell"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I was unable to reach a conclusion. First of all, at the time
I compared this signature the known standards of Lee Harvey Oswald were inadequate
for this particular comparison.</p>

<p>I did, however, note that there were certain differences in this signature that
indicate the possibility of someone other than Oswald having prepared it. But in
my opinion, the characteristics I observed were not of sufficient weight for a
positive opinion in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you note those characteristics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; I think the capital letter "A" and the capital letter "H"
in "Hidell" are different from the "A's" that Oswald makes, that appear in the
enlarged photographs, Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I think the lower case "d," especially in the rounded shape of
the body of it and the relatively short height of the staff, so that the staff compared
to the body is very short. The "J" is made different or in a different
manner than Oswald regularly makes or usually makes his "J's" in the known
standards, but again it is a question of judgment as to whether you believe a
combination of characteristics is enough to either eliminate or identify. In
this instance, in my opinion, these differences point to the possibility of another
writer other than Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You indicated before, also, that there was another ink used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That is correct. This, of course, in and of itself, is of no consequence,
since the same person can use two different pens, so the color of the
ink would not be, in my mind, significant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does that signature appear to have been written naturally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. At normal speed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Any evidence of retouching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Generally, were the signatures and other handwritings in the
questioned documents you have reviewed in this deposition today written
naturally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. With the exception of the "Hidell" signature on his certificate
of vaccination. There is, in my opinion, distortion present there. But, by and
large, in fact in almost all of the various handwritings, hand printings, and signatures,
there is no evidence of disguise or distortion, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What type of evidence indicates disguise or distortion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Distortion and disguise can take many forms. It can be in the
form of a change in slant, a deliberate malformation of the individual letters.
It can be shown in broken or interrupted strokes. It can be shown in waves or
wiggles in the line itself which should not normally be there. It may be
occasioned by a person using other than normal hand, a left-handed person
writing with his right hand or a right-handed person writing with his left hand.
All these introduce elements of distoration or disguise. The extent of it can
only be determined by comparing a given writing with known writings, and
observing the characteristics present, and on that basis you can then formulate
an opinion as to whether or not there is any appreciable amount of distortion
or disguise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How would you evaluate the possibility of another person
having simulated the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald in these questioned
documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I don't think there is any possibility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. On what do you base that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. I base that on 23 years experience and judgment and the examination
of the documents and the various writings involved in this instance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And do I understand that if that had happened, the person
would have left evidence behind which you would have detected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. In my opinion, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that would be in what form?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. It would be in many forms. Failure to incorporate into the
writings things that should be there, and including in the writings things that
are not in Oswald's writing, differences in slant, spacing, proportions of letters,
both to other letters and proportions of letters within themselves, the adoption
of the various variations that you find in the known writings. When the
amount of writing approaches the amount involved here, there is a large,
a relatively large volume of questioned writings. The possibilities of successful
or undetectible forgery, in my opinion, are nil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cadigan, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1,
which is a note in the Russian language in cyrillic print, and ask you whether
you have examined that item?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I now hand you Commission Exhibit Nos. 55, 56, and 66,
consisting of various notes in the cyrillic language, rather in the Russian
language in cyrillic print, and ask you whether you have examined those
notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Who is the purported signer of those notes, Exhibits Nos.
55, 56, and 66?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. From the translation that I read these are purportedly written
by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, for the record, these have also been identified by Marina
as having been written by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>And these are signed Alek in some or all cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; they are signed A-l-e-k, Alek in all three instances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again, for the record, this is a name which was used for
Oswald during his period of staying in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Have you attempted to determine whether Commission Exhibit No. 1 was
written by the person who wrote Commission Exhibits Nos. 55, 56, and 66?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. That Commission Exhibit No. 1 was written by Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you prepared photographs of Commission Exhibits Nos.
55, 56, and 66?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; of the letters contained in those exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I will mark those as Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 25, 26, 27, and 28.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 25, 26, 27,
and 28.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you also taken a photograph of Commission Exhibit
No 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I will mark that as Cadigan Exhibit No. <span class="locked">29&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Front and back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And Cadigan Exhibit No. 30, representing respectively the
back and front of Commission Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 29 and 30.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, by use of photographs Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 25 through
30, could you explain some of the reasons which led you to your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes; and I would point out that in addition to the four enlargements
written in Russian, I also used Cadigan Exhibits or the documents
represented by Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10, the known standards of
Oswald, since there are English letters interspersed with the Russian writing
on Commission Exhibit No. 1. Thus, for example, in the second line in Cadigan
Exhibit No. 29 appears the word "to" which is directly comparable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
same word appearing in Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10. This is characterized
by a long sweeping upstroke, and the recurving downstroke cuts the
staff about in half. And the "o" is without any tail, and it is relatively small
and set fairly close into the staff. The "t" crossing is rather long and fairly
high.</p>

<p>I noted these same characteristics in Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10.</p>

<p>Further, there is the wording in English, "Red Cross" appearing about two-thirds
of the way down the side of the page beginning with the numeral 6,
and here, again, I noted the same characteristics in the English hand printing
in Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 4 through 10. Again, the use of the small "e" and the
small "d" in conjunction with the capital "R," and then in the word "cross"
he has used the capital letters. On the face of the Commission Exhibit No. 1
appear the printed English letters "ERVAY" which are almost directly comparable
with the name "Lee Harvey Oswald" in Cadigan Exhibit No. 10. The
E here is characterized by the little loop at the base of the staff. The "R"
has a flat closed loop on the left side of the staff. The "Y" is constructed of
two strokes, almost a perfect "V" shape for the body and a tail slanting back
away from it.</p>

<p>The letter "p" or what appears to be the letter "p," indicated by the roman
numeral 2 and a red arrow, is similar to the English "p," characterized by a
long narrow staff without much of a loop. The body of the letter extends above
the staff and the base is open. The bottom of the letter is not closed in.</p>

<p>The numeral "1" on the chart Cadigan Exhibit No. 29 points to a Russian
character which resembles somewhat the English letter "G," the capital letter
G. This is characterized by a rather large elongated loop along the left side
of the upstroke, and the finishing stroke is short and straight.</p>

<p>The numeral "3" in red on Cadigan Exhibit No. 29 points to the Russian word
which resembles the English word "tbi." The "t" has a very long beginning
upstroke. The crossing of the "t" is high and is at the top of the letter. The
b is formed with a straight staff on the back side, and there is a well spaced
connection to the following letter which resembles the English letter "i."</p>

<p>I further noted that on this same side of the document shown in Cadigan
Exhibit No. 29 in the second to the last line from the bottom appears the
combination "exa," which is directly comparable with the "exa" in "Texas"
appearing on the photograph Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 6, 4, and 9, among others.
Again this characteristic way of making the "x" is almost like a "u" or an
open "o." There is a little extra stroke that breaks off of the "x" so that
instead of looking like "exa" it has the appearance of "eva" with a diagonal
stroke through the "v."</p>

<p>The number "6" in red on Cadigan Exhibit No. 29 points to the combination
which looks like the English letters "Ha," where the same two letters appear
on the photographs, Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 25 and 26, the "H" being made in
two roughly parallel straight strokes. The "a" is almost in the form of a
circle, and the tail of the "a" runs out horizontally to the line of writing.</p>

<p>On Cadigan Exhibit No. 30, the number "8" in red with an arrow points to the
combination of letters which resemble the English letters "tak," and this same
combination or the same letters appear on Cadigan Exhibit No. 27. Again, the
"t" has a rather long beginning stroke. The crossing is high and long, and I
noted that the "k" in both instances is made in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The figure "9" on Cadigan Exhibit No. 30 also points to a different style of
k, or what resembles the English letter "k," in that it is composed of a straight
staff and the body or the right portion of the letter is almost the shape of a
v tilted on its side.</p>

<p>Because of this combination of characteristics, as well as many others, I
reached the opinion that Government's Exhibit No. 1 was written by Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 1, that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cadigan</span>. Yes, of which Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 30 and 29 are photographic
enlargements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I have no further questions, Mr. Cadigan. Thank you very
much. You have been extremely helpful.</p>

<h2 id="t439">AFFIDAVIT OF EARLENE ROBERTS</h2>

<p>The following affidavit was executed by Earlene Roberts on December 5, 1963.</p>

<p class="in0 right">
AFFIDAVIT</p>
<p class="in0">PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION<br />
ON THE ASSASSINATION OF<br />
PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">State of Texas</span>,<br />
<i>County of Dallas, ss</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>I, Earlene Roberts, after being duly sworn, do depose and state:</p>

<p>I live at 1026 Beckley, Dallas, Texas, where I serve as housekeeper for a rooming
house owned by Mr. &amp; Mrs. A.&nbsp;C. Johnson.</p>

<p>On Friday, November 22, 1963, at approximately 1:00 pm I was sitting in the
living room watching television about the President's assassination when a man
I knew as O.&nbsp;H. Lee, but who has since been identified as Lee Harvey Oswald,
came into the front door and went to his room. Oswald did not have a jacket
when he came in the house and I don't recall what type of clothing he was
wearing.</p>

<p>Oswald went to his room and was only there a very few minutes before coming
out. I noticed he had a jacket he was putting on. I recall the jacket was a dark
color and it was the type that zips up the front. He was zipping the jacket up as
he left.</p>

<p>Oswald went out the front door. A moment later I looked out the window. I
saw Lee Oswald standing on the curb at the bus stop just to the right, and on the
same side of the street as our house. I just glanced out the window that once.
I don't know how long Lee Oswald stood at the curb nor did I see which direction
he went when he left there.</p>

<p>About thirty minutes later three Dallas policemen came to the house looking
for Lee Harvey Oswald. We didn't know who Lee Harvey Oswald was until
sometime later his picture was flashed on television. I then let the Dallas policemen
in the room occupied by Lee Oswald. While the Dallas police were searching
the room two FBI agents came in.</p>

<p>The police and FBI agents took everything in the room that belong to Lee
Oswald and also took our pillow case and two towels and wash cloths.</p>

<p>I have made this statement, consisting of three pages, to Special Agents
William N. Carter and Arthur W. Blake of the U.S. Secret Service. I have read
this statement over and I find it to be true to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="t439a">AFFIDAVIT OF RALPH W. YARBOROUGH</h2>

<p>The following affidavit was executed by Ralph W. Yarborough on July 10, 1964.</p>

<p class="in0 right">
AFFIDAVIT</p>
<p class="in0">PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION<br />
ON THE ASSASSINATION OF<br />
PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">District of Columbia</span>, <i>ss</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>In response to the oral request of one of the attorneys for the Commission
that I send you an affidavit for inclusion in the record of the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy, I make the following statement:</p>

<p>On November 22, 1963, as the President and Mrs. Kennedy rode through the
streets of Dallas, I was in the second car behind them. The first car behind the
Presidential car was the Secret Service car; the second car behind them was
Vice-President Lyndon Johnson's car. The driver and a secret service agent were
on the front seat of the Vice-President's car. Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson
sat on the right side of the rear seat of the automobile, Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson
was in the center of the rear seat, while I sat on the left side of the rear seat.</p>

<p>After the Presidential motorcade had passed through the heart of downtown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
Dallas, experiencing an exceptionally warm and friendly greeting, as the motorcade
went down the slope of Elm Street toward the railroad underpass, a rifle
shot was heard by me; a loud blast, close by. I have handled firearms for fifty
year, and thought immediately that it was a rifle shot. When the noise of the
shot was heard, the motorcade slowed to what seemed to me a complete stop
(though it could have been a near stop). After what I took to be about three
seconds, another shot boomed out, and after what I took to be one-half the time
between the first and second shots (calculated now, this would have put the third
shot about one and one-half seconds after the second shot&mdash;by my estimate&mdash;to me
there seemed to be a long time between the first and second shots, a much
shorter time between the second and third shots&mdash;these were my impressions
that day), a third shot was fired. After the third shot was fired, but only after
the third shot was fired, the cavalcade speeded up, gained speed rapidly, and
roared away to the Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>I heard three shots and no more. All seemed to come from my right rear. I
saw people fall to the ground on the embankment to our right, at about the time
of or after the second shot, but before the cavalcade started up and raced away.</p>

<p>Due to the second car, with the secret service men standing on steps on the
sides of it, I could not see what was happening in the Presidential car during
the shooting itself. Some of the secret service men looked backward and to
the right, in the general direction from which the rifle explosions seemed to come.</p>

<p>After the shooting, one of the secret service men sitting down in the car in
front of us pulled out an automatic rifle or weapon and looked backward. However,
all of the secret service men seemed to me to respond very slowly, with
no more than a puzzled look. In fact, until the automatic weapon was uncovered,
I had been lulled into a sense of false hope for the President's safety, by the lack
of motion, excitement, or apparent visible knowledge by the secret service men,
that anything so dreadful was happening. Knowing something of the training
that combat infantrymen and Marines receive, I am amazed at the lack of
instantaneous response by the Secret Service, when the rifle fire began. I make
this statement in this paragraph reluctantly, not to add to the anguish of anyone,
but it is my firm opinion, and I write it out in the hope that it might be of
service in the better protection of our Presidents in the future.</p>

<p>After we went under the underpass, on the upward slope I could see over
the heads of the occupants of the second car (Secret Service car) and could see
an agent lying across the back or trunk of the Presidential car, with his feet to
the right side of the car, his head at the left side. He beat the back of the car
with one hand, his face contorted by grief, anguish, and despair, and I knew
from that instant that some terrible loss had been suffered.</p>

<p>On arrival at the hospital, I told newsmen that three rifle shots had been fired.
There was then no doubt in my mind that the shots were rifle shots, and I had
neither then or now any doubts that any other shots were fired. In my opinion
only three shots were fired.</p>

<p>The attached photograph from pages 24 and 25 of the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>
of December 14, 1963, shows the motorcade, as I remember it, an instant after the
first shot. [Photograph is Yarborough Exhibit A.]</p>

<p>Given and sworn to this 10th day of July, 1964, at Washington, District of
Columbia.</p>

<h2 id="t440">TESTIMONY OF KENNETH P. O'DONNELL</h2>

<p>The testimony of Kenneth P. O'Donnell was taken at 12:05 p.m., on May 18,
1964, at the White House Office, Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Norman Redlich
and Arlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you rise, please? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you shall give in this deposition proceeding before the President's Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
on the Assassination of President Kennedy will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. O'Donnell, the purpose of our asking you to testify today is
to obtain whatever knowledge you have about the origin of the trip to Texas by
President Kennedy, the events during the trip, and the trip back to Washington,
D.C., on November 22. With that general statement of purpose, I will ask you
if you have any objection to giving a deposition at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Kenneth P. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your duties on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I was special assistant to the President. I was in charge of
his appointments and any itineraries that he might have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long had you served in that capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I served as special assistant to the President since the inauguration,
January 20, 1961, with the same duties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you a party to the original conversations and decision for
President Kennedy to make a trip to Texas in November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline the origin of that trip to Texas, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The origin of the trip I would think came from a conversation
between the President, then Vice President Johnson, and myself. It concerned
President Kennedy's desire, and President Johnson's desire that he come
to Texas and spend some time there, looking forward to the campaign of 1964,
in which Texas would play a very vital role in President Kennedy's view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately when did that first conversation occur, Mr.
O'Donnell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We had been discussing this for almost 6 or 7 months, but the
time had never seemed quite right, either in the Vice President's mind or in
Governor Connally's mind. Governor Connally and the Vice President had discussed
this. They arrived at a general agreement that it be done some time in
the latter part of the month of November. I think this decision probably came
in October, some time in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When had President Kennedy been in Dallas prior to the trip
of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The last time the President had been in Dallas was as a
candidate for the Presidency.</p>

<p>I correct myself. He had been to&mdash;visit Speaker Rayburn in the hospital.
I was not on that trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then aside from the trip to see Speaker Rayburn, in the hospital,
had the President been in Dallas at all since the campaign of 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know approximately when it was that President Kennedy
visited Speaker Rayburn in the hospital in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't know exactly. It would be just before he passed away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does October 1961 sound about right to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. It sounds about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how many times had President Kennedy been to Texas
between the campaign of 1960 and November 1963, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, he had been to the Speaker's funeral at Bonham. He
had been to Houston, to see the new space center, and also he spoke at Rice
Stadium. And he had been to El Paso, on a military inspection tour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are those, then, all the trips he made, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. That is all I can recollect at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In a general way, what was the purpose of the President's trip
to Texas in November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, he hadn't conducted any political activities in Texas.
There were great controversies existing. There was a party problem in Texas
that the President and the Vice President felt he could be helpful, as both sides
of the controversy were supporting President Kennedy, and they felt he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
be a bridge between these two groups, and this would be helpful in the election
of 1964. I think that is the major reason for the trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was President Kennedy motivated, to any extent at all, by his
interest in making himself as President available to the people generally in
every section of the country, including Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Very definitely. The President's views of his responsibilities
as President of the United States were that he meet the people, that he go out
to their homes and see them, and allow them to see him, and discuss, if possible,
the views of the world as he sees it, the problems of the country as he sees them.
And he felt that leaving Washington for the President of the United States
was most necessary&mdash;not only for the people, but for the President himself,
that he expose himself to the actual basic problems that were disturbing the
American people. It helped him in his job here, he was able to come back
here with a fresh view of many things. I think he felt very strongly that the
President ought to get out of Washington, and go meet the people on a regular
basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he enjoy that exposure, strictly as a personal matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He enjoyed it very much. The President&mdash;liked people, and
he liked to mingle with people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When were the specific dates of November 21 and November 22
finally set as being the precise times for the trip to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I am not clear in my recollection of that. I would
think some time early in November. I know Thanksgiving was one of the problems
we had to work with. We decided that would be the best time to go, in
that general area, and we, in general, would keep a file&mdash;once we agreed we were
going to Texas&mdash;we would keep a file on all the speaking engagements, all the
invitations the President had received.</p>

<p>I would go to that file and select some that might look promising. One of
them that I recollect was an invitation from Congressman Albert Thomas, or his
committee, that was giving him an appreciation dinner&mdash;not the Congressman
himself. And the President was very fond of Congressman Thomas, he was
most helpful to him, and I knew he would want to go, if this was at all possible.
I would think that probably had more to do with setting the actual definite
dates of the 21st and 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, if you recall, was the Secret Service notified of the forthcoming
trip to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would think they would be notified around the first week
in November. The general desire is that they have the specific information at
least on the places that he might go 3 weeks prior to the trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who among the members of the Presidential staff would be
charged with the responsibility for coordinating the trip with the Secret
Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. That would be my responsibility. The manner in which we
would set it up would be that I would notify the head here, who is Gerry Behn,
and Gerry Behn would ask me when we were sending people down, so that his
people and our people could go down at the same time. And I recollect that
Jerry Bruno was one of them.</p>

<p>The first step would be to confer with the Governor, go over the general proposals
that the Governor would make, and then bring it back to me. And I
would go over it with the Governor and the Vice President and the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What planning was undertaken with respect to the determination
of the motorcade route through Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I think once we arrived&mdash;we chose the four cities we
were going into. And then the advance men and the Secret Service went out.
Then we would work backwards from where we had to be at what time, and
what things we had agreed we would do there. And the original&mdash;Dallas, as I
recollect, was going to be an evening affair. The Governor thought the evening
affair should be in Austin, and that we should hit Dallas around noontime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say the evening affair, what are you referring to
specifically there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. There was a political dinner which was to be conducted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Austin that evening, at the end of which the President was going with the
Vice President to the ranch. This was a political fundraising dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, had there been any conversation given at all to omitting
a motorcade through Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what were the considerations behind the decision on having
a motorcade through Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, we had a motorcade wherever we went. Particularly
when we went to a large city, the purpose of going there was to give the President
as much exposure to the people of Dallas and vice versa, the people of Dallas to
the President, as possible.</p>

<p>The speaking engagement was a luncheon which was rather limited. And the
President would not want to leave Dallas feeling that the only ones that were
able to see him were a rather select group. So it would be automatic, and we
would not even proceed with instructions, that the advance man and the Secret
Service would, within the time allotted to them&mdash;would bring the President into
Dallas, through an area which exposes him to the greatest number of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was a decision made, if you recall, as to the precise route
that the motorcade would follow through Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't recall. I would think it would be perhaps a week
before the final decision was made. The President would not involve himself in
anything like this. Once we agreed on where he would go, that was my responsibility
to work it out. The normal course of events&mdash;they would say to me, "Do
you want a motorcade in Dallas?" I would say, "Yes; this is how much time
you have got." They would work out a motorcade. The Secret Service would
time the route. Once they had worked out this point, they would come back to me
and say, "We have accomplished the purpose you want." The Secret Service
would say it takes so much time, the Governor would say "You have to be here
at a certain time." Once all those are put together, the route is laid out and
accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall how long after the determination of the motorcade
route that that information was transmitted to the press in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't. I would think on the transmission to the press that
that would not come from here anyway. That would come from down there. I
would think the Governor's office would probably put that out. We would under
normal circumstances inform through Mr. Salinger's office, I would inform him
of the trip, and then I would give him a schedule that is given to me by the
Secret Service, which would give the times, but no routes&mdash;times and locations,
and would go along that he would arrive at 12 o'clock, address such and such
a group at 1 o'clock. So we would not normally be privy&mdash;they could be saying
to me, "We are going down 12th Street"&mdash;it would not mean anything to me.
So I would think that our advance man and the Governor's advance man would
make a decision on when they were going to announce the route.</p>

<p>I would think that was almost normal. You might say you wanted to do it 4
days ahead of time in New York, and the local fellow would really determine it&mdash;"Down
here we do it this way."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would the route be disclosed to the press as a matter of normal
procedure in general as soon as it was ascertained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any factors peculiar to Dallas which delayed the
determination of the motorcade route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The only factor that really did hold up a final decision was
we had not been able to finally agree on where he would end up and where he
would deliver the speech. There was a controversy between the Governor, and
between some of the local democratic figures, and between our people, as to
whether the place finally selected was the best place for the President to give
the address. The Governor felt very strongly on it. And we finally acquiesced to
his views. But I would think that came rather late in the game, and it would
have altered the route quite dramatically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you tell us if there was any consideration at all given to
omitting Dallas as a stop on the trip in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't think so; no. I would think that the President would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
not have&mdash;once he had agreed to go to three or four other cities, that he could
not possibly go to Texas and avoid Dallas. It would cause more controversy&mdash;and
it would not accomplish for us what really was the long-range purpose of
the visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the long-range purpose was what, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Was to attempt to in some way bridge the gap between the
two political groups in Texas who were at odds, and to assist the President and
prepare for the 1964 campaign as best he could at this period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the President's reaction towards Dallas generally, if
you know, with respect to the current publicity about, say, Ambassador Stevenson's
reception there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, he was not in anyway concerned about it. I think that
the President was a very charitable man. He felt that really the picture of
Dallas as painted&mdash;and as a reflection of their press in many ways&mdash;was not the
real picture of Dallas; that they were Americans like everybody else, that there
were good and bad, and the fact that 50 shouting people didn't portray the city
of Dallas. He had been there in the 1960 campaign when the Vice President had
been spit upon, and the President received one of the finest receptions he ever got.
He didn't carry the city. They opposed him. But they were not particularly
different than anybody else. And that wouldn't concern him, and I think,
very frankly, the more difficult it was the more he liked to go there. But I
think he generally felt that the loud noises emanating from Dallas were a very
small minority, and so reflected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had there been any discussion about limiting the trip to Texas
to a 1 day venture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't recollect any. I do know one of the original thoughts
was that he go to this dinner in Austin, which was a political dinner. Whether
there was any consideration in some other people's minds that he just go in for
the dinner and leave, I know he, number 1, would not consider it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He would not consider it because he had a great aversion
to going into any place to a fundraising political dinner in which he felt that
the people that were there were not really representative of the people, but
were politically committed people, where it was a business meeting. And he
thought this reflected to some degree on the office of the Presidency, that on his
only visit to Texas, or any other State in 3 years, that he came to raise money
for a political party, that he owed to the people to expose himself to them. So he
he felt it was a duty of the Presidency to expose himself to the public. So he
would not go to any place on a purely&mdash;but he certainly considered there were
some political problems in Texas&mdash;that would also be in his judgment a bad
political mistake. So I don't think there was ever any question that he would
go some place else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you accompany the President on all phases of the trip to
Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I was with him when he left. The only time that I was
not with him was at Congressman Thomas' dinner. He went to the dinner. We
ate at the hotel and went directly to the airport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you depart, then, from Washington, on that trip to
Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, we left that morning by helicopter from the lawn. I
think the records show it is 10:45. But the schedule was on time, certainly
arriving there, and, as I recollect, we were on time pretty much the whole way
as the schedule would reflect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And from the helicopter at the White House lawn, where was
your first stop by helicopter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We stopped and boarded <i>Air Force 1</i> at Andrews Air Force
Base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would the time of 11 a.m., as reflected in the records, be accurate
as your point of departure, then, from Andrews Air Force Base?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes; I would think it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And your first stop in Texas was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. San Antonio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Arrival time of 1:30 p.m.&mdash;would that be an accurate time of
arrival, within a few minutes, say, of when you actually set down in San
Antonio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would think that is right. As I say, we were on schedule,
and the schedule would indicate we were due to arrive at 1:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the activities at San Antonio, Tex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We motorcaded through San Antonio and went to the Aerospace
Medical Center, where the President made a speech, and from there to a
second airport. We had moved <i>Air Force 1</i> from one airfield to another, on the
other side of the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the Aerospace Center, was there a dedication there of some
new facilities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other public appearance, then, besides the one
you mentioned, in San Antonio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To where did you go from San Antonio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We flew to Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And about what time did you arrive in Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would have to look at the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it late in the afternoon on November 21?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Late in the afternoon, I would think around 4 or 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what were the activities in Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We drove from the airfield into the hotel. As I recollect,
there were very large crowds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that a motorcade procession, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Motorcade; and particularly as we got in downtown Houston,
the crowds were very large, and very enthusiastic. Getting in the hotel was
somewhat of a chore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What public appearances did the President then make in
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The President spoke at the appreciation dinner for Congressman
Thomas. The records will show the location. I did not accompany
him. And I went directly from the hotel to the airport, and met him as he
got aboard the plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately when did the Presidential party depart from
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I would have to guess again. I would think around
10:30 or 11 o'clock. The alternative was staying overnight in Houston, getting
in early in the morning&mdash;or getting in to Fort Worth late at night, and allowing
the President a little more rest, and we selected going to Fort Worth that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the public appearances made by the President, then,
in Fort Worth, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He spoke at 8 o'clock that morning at a breakfast which
was given by the business community, as I remember, came back up to his
room, chatted for a few minutes, went back down. It had been raining. The
sun had just come out. He went out and spoke to a group assembled in the
parking lot and went back and departed for&mdash;came back upstairs, we chatted
for a few minutes again, and then came back down and departed for Carswell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how did the President travel out of Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He left Fort Worth in an open car, traveled by car to
Carswell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And from Carswell, what was his mode of travel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. <i>Air Force 1</i> to Love Field, Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the weather conditions on the arrival at Love Field
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The weather was clear, sunny, excellent weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What decision had been made as to whether to have an open car
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The decision had been made to have an open&mdash;if the weather
was good, he would ride in an open car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you recall who made that decision?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I would make that decision under normal circumstances.
But it was almost an automatic decision, that whenever the weather
was clear, he preferred to ride in an open car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall at approximately what time the Presidential party
arrived at Love Field, Tex.&mdash;Love Field, Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would think it would be around 11, 11:15. We were on
time. We always allowed a few minutes at the airport, because he always
shook hands with the crowd. So we left&mdash;my recollection is that we departed
from Love Field approximately according to the schedule.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were President Kennedy's activities at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He had no scheduled activities. It was a matter of assembling
the motorcade. He got off <i>Air Force 1</i>, and he went over to the crowd that
was gathered around the rail, shook hands, went up and down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What type of a crowd was it with respect to size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. It was a large crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you tell us how the motorcade was constituted with
respect to the general number of the cars and the way they were lined up,
if you recall, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I can't go more than&mdash;I got into the second car, and
I didn't really look behind me. There was some controversy as to what Congressman
sat in what car. We had a lot of Congressmen with us and a lot of
dignitaries, and there was a lot of juggling around, which Mr. O'Brien was
more involved with than I was, as to where Senator Yarborough and the Vice
President and the Congressman sat. But it was a lengthy motorcade, more
lengthy than normal. We always tried to keep them down as much as possible.
But because of the number of Congressmen and the dignitaries involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many cars were there ahead of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I think there was a scout car, which was the lead, the
President's vehicle, and I was in the car right behind him, in the Secret
Service followup car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who else besides you was in that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. David Powers was with me. All the rest were agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall whether anything unusual occurred on the trip
from Love Field down to the center of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. No; I thought it was normal&mdash;the crowds, going through
the suburbs, were, I would say, from medium to heavy for that trip. I noted
they were mostly white collar, mostly industrial places we passed by which I
would say were highly technical. Therefore, the crowd reflected a middle to an
upper class type. They were not unfriendly nor terribly enthusiastic. They
waved. But were reserved, I thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you seated in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I was seated in the front jump seat&mdash;the jump seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the left-hand side or the right-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Left-hand side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who sat on your immediate right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Mr. Powers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many agents were there in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, there were the normal two or sometimes three in the
front seat. I would not be clear as to how many there were. I would think
there were about&mdash;just guessing&mdash;seven or eight agents in the car. Some on
the running board, some seated, depending on the speed of the motorcade, or the
activity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there a front seat in the car, immediately ahead of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was that occupied by Secret Service agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about immediately to your rear? Was there a rear seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. There was a rear seat. There were agents in that&mdash;again depending
on the speed of the motorcade they were either on the running board,
or as it slows up and the crowds got larger the agents would get on the running
board. But as it moved along rather rapidly, as it did on the way in, they were
seated most of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall whether or not the President's automobile made
any stops en route from the airport into the downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't recollect, clearly. I would be surprised if it did not.
But I don't have any clear recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it a usual practice for the President to make a stop on the
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. If the crowds got too large, he would stop, or if he saw some
child had gone to some great extreme with a sign, he would sometimes stop.
Usually unless the crowds were particularly heavy, or indicated a need for a
stop, he would not stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the nature of the crowd in downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The nature of the crowd was extremely heavy, one of the
heaviest I have seen in any American city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did they compare with the crowds during the 1960 campaign
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would think probably heavier. But very close. They were
both very large crowds, very enthusiastic. I think, as I have always noticed, to
the President and candidate there is a different aura. But that would be the
only difference I would notice in the crowd. There was a little bit more respect&mdash;still
the same enthusiasm. At the last trip in Dallas he stopped the motorcade
every 5 minutes&mdash;they mobbed the car. There was none of that. But they were
in the middle of the street and off the sidewalks. So there was a very narrow
lane to progress through. But they were still very orderly, but cheerful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any specific reaction to the Dallas crowd in terms
of what your expectation might have been about Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I was pleased with it. As a politician, I was particularly
pleased with it. I thought we had accomplished what we had come to
Dallas to do, was, one, to establish the fact that the average person living in that
city was no different than any other American, and that they respected and admired
their President. And I felt one of the greatest things that does occur of
a political nature is the Congressmen and the political leaders who had also been
reading the same newspaper about how unpopular he was, it is good for them
to see it really is not true, it is a reflection of a very small minority, and that
the President of the United States was extremely popular in Dallas.</p>

<p>And that was the basic reason we went. And as we finished through the
business section of town, that was my pleased impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall the scene when you left the Main Street of downtown
Dallas, with respect specifically to the presence of a large building which
was immediately ahead of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I did not. I was looking at the crowd. And I frankly didn't
look at the building, except when there were people in the windows. And as we
made that turn, I had been standing&mdash;I remember I sat down. And as far as I
was concerned, that was the end&mdash;we were then going to the luncheon&mdash;and I
didn't notice any building at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you familiar with the identity of the specific plaza there,
being known as Dealey Plaza?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I was not. I afterward have reflected on it many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell us what occurred then as you made that turn away from the
crowded downtown Dallas area and headed toward the plaza area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I sat down. I remember saying to Dave Powers that it
was a fantastic crowd. He agreed.</p>

<p>We turned. I remember the overpass. And then the shots occurred&mdash;which,
at that time, I did not know were shots. My first impression was it was a firecracker.
And then either somebody said, "He has been hit," or I noticed the
slump&mdash;he had been waving out the right side of the car, and I noticed him
slump over toward Mrs. Kennedy, and I realized then that they had been shots.
But as fast as that realization occurred, I saw the third shot hit. It was such a
perfect shot&mdash;I remember I blessed myself. I was rather convinced that was a
fatal blow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say you made a turn, which way did the motorcade
turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Turned to the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And approximately how far behind the Presidential vehicle was
the followup car at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. My guess would be 5 to 8 feet, the normal&mdash;when there are
large crowds, pressing in on the side, they try to stay close. It was moving at
a steady pace. The crowds were orderly. So he was at a normal&mdash;I would presume
they were just about turning to step up the speed a little bit, because there
would be no crowds from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate of the speed of the President's vehicle
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I would think we probably were going between 15 and
20, up until that moment, and I think he probably had just begun to accelerate
probably up to about 25, somewhere in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had the Secret Service followup car completed its left-hand turn
prior to the time the shots rang out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. My recollection is they had, just about.</p>

<p>I don't recollect a separation of this nature. It was a slight sloping turn, as
I remember, and I thought we were right together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that when you just indicated with your hands, you were
showing a pattern of the Secret Service car having made the turn and straightened
up immediately behind the Presidential vehicle proceeding down the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. That is my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the overpass in sight at that time, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On which side of the car was President Kennedy seated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He was on the right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The extreme right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The extreme right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was he doing with his hands prior to the time of
the shooting, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He was waving. We had just left the mass of crowds. But
as we turned on the grass plot there were four or five people there, and I believe
he waved to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating a right-handed wave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was Governor Connally seated with respect to the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He was directly in front of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether or not the President's seat was raised or
was it in its extreme low position at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what the President's practice was as to whether
or not the seat would be raised?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't know that, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what the controls were on the Presidential automobile
for raising or lowering the President's seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many shots were there in all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to the total time which elapsed
from the first shot to the last shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would say 5 to 6 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was there any distinguishable tempo to the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes; the first two came almost simultaneously, came one
right after the other, there was a slight hesitation, then the third one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was your reaction as to the source of the shots, if you
had one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. My reaction in part is reconstruction&mdash;is that they came
from the right rear. That would be my best judgment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any reaction by any of the other people around in
any specific direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The agents all turned to the rear. I would think, watching
the reaction of the President when the shot&mdash;the first shot hit&mdash;that it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
be automatic it would have to have come from the rear. I think any experienced
agent would make that assumption immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the reaction of the agents which you have referred to
as coming from the rear, to the right rear or to the left rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The reaction I note would be right rear. And, again, looking
at the manner of the President's movement, I would think you would have to
feel the thrust of the shot was from the right rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what was there about the President's movement which
leads you to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He was leaning out waving. He may have just been withdrawing
his hand. And the shot hit him, and threw him to the left. He slumped
on Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to determine a reaction on that slumping movement,
as to whether it was the first, the second, or the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. It was not the third shot. Whether it was the first or second,
I would not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think it could have been the second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes; I do. If I had to pick one of the two, I think it might
have been the second shot. It seemed to be&mdash;but, again, it is a foggy recollection&mdash;it
seemed to have been that his movement coincided&mdash;with such a slight
difference of time that is just guesswork.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any reaction of Governor Connally in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I saw the Governor turn toward the President. The President,
in that period of time, had been&mdash;they were one right behind the other.
And the only reason I would even notice it was when the President had slumped
to the left, the Governor then turned, and he was in my view. Otherwise, he
would not have been. But the President slumped over, and, therefore, the Governor
just turned and I could see him. I had no knowledge that he had been
hit at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you get the first knowledge that he had been hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. When the third shot came. The President was hit. The
motorcade accelerated. And one of the agents said, "The Governor has been
hit, too."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Prior to the time that President Kennedy shifted to the left, then,
could you see the Governor at all from your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Depending on how each one moved, normally, no. The President
was directly behind the Governor. But if the President was over to the
right waving, then you could see the Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the President's left when the <span class="locked">Governor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. If the President was all the way to the right, the Governor,
who was in front of him, would be visible to us. If they were both sitting, they
were not. But they did confer back and forth. So the Governor was visible
upon occasion. But when he turned around, it was really the first time I had been
able to see him clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At a time, though, when the President was on the extreme right-hand
side, waving, would the Governor then have been visible on the President's
left or on his right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He would be on his left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the jump seat situated, if you know, to the precise front
of the President, to the right, to the left, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What reaction did you observe, if any, as to Mrs. Kennedy during
the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, he slumped on her. She appeared to be immediately
aware that something had happened. She turned toward him. And then the
third shot hit. Obviously, she then knew what happened. She turned, looking
at the backup car. Meanwhile Agent Hill had gotten off the car and started
running up. She was clambering toward the back, and reached his hand, and he
was on the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any reactions in the President's car other than
those which you have now testified about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what point did the motorcade accelerate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. It accelerated, I would think, right about at the time that
Agent Hill grabbed onto the back of the car, which would be just a few seconds
after the last shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at what speed did the motorcade proceed en route to the
hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Very rapidly. I would guess between 60 and 70 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how long did it take for the motorcade to get to the
hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would guess 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far behind the President's car was the followup car in which
you were riding at the time the President's car arrived at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Right behind it, 5 or 6 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What occurred at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We got out of the car. David Powers got out of the car, went
over to the President, and was not visible to me, and was crying, he laid on
him. And then they came and took the President&mdash;that was the first time I
really realized that Governor Connally had been badly hurt, as they also carried
Governor Connally out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was Mrs. Kennedy doing at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I believe somebody had helped her out and taken her into the
hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there a coat over President Kennedy at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. When they took him out, I was standing maybe 3 or 4 feet
behind him. There was a wall of people between myself. I didn't see him, nor
did I look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know who lifted the President out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know who lifted the Governor out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By what means were they taken away from the vicinity of the
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I think they had stretchers. As I say, I was far enough back
at that moment that they were milling around, and so many people between my
vision and what they were doing, I did not see. I could not be accurate on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next, Mr. O'Donnell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I went into the hospital and went right to Mrs. Kennedy.
She was seated right outside the room where they had placed the President. I
would say she was in a total daze, and as yet not knowing whether there was
any hope or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your activities in the period of time immediately
following that moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, I stayed with her for a few minutes, and then no one
seemed to be able to get any conclusive answer as to the President's condition.
As I said, I had seen the shots so clearly, I had a pretty clear view. The first
thing I had done&mdash;I asked them to get a priest, which they did immediately. I
went into the room. There were four or five doctors there. Dr. Burkley I
think was there. And I said, "I think we better get a definite answer one way
or another&mdash;is there any hope at all?" I was unable to get a conclusive answer.
But I think I got the answer I needed.</p>

<p>I don't know how Mrs. Kennedy was finally told. I may have told her about
at that moment. Between the time and the time I knew definitely, I went to see
the Vice President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was with him at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Mrs. Johnson was with him and an agent who at the time I
did not know. I believe it is Youngblood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was Vice President Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He was in a room across the hall. You had to go directly
across what would probably be the reception room, which was open to the public,
and into another room. And I recollect I turned to my right, and he was over
more or less in the corner with a screen. He was standing on the right, Mrs.
Johnson, I believe, was sitting, the agent was standing at the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what conversations, if any, did you have with then-Vice
President Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I told him it looked very, very serious, and in my opinion that
it was probably fatal. I hadn't been able to get a totally definite answer, but
that I would let him know as soon as it was definite&mdash;but it looked pretty
black.</p>

<p>I then left him. I don't recollect that he even commented. I left him and
went back to Mrs. Kennedy, and within a very few minutes they confirmed the
fact that the President was dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. As soon as I was assured that he was dead, and it was
definite, I went back to the Vice President and informed him the President
was dead, and that in my opinion he ought to get out of there as fast as he
could. We had a general discussion. The President's first words to me were that
we must look upon this in a sense that it might be a conspiracy of some nature,
and that all security must be taken, and that we then discussed whether one
of the possible movements might be to move the Presidential aircraft from
Love Field to Carswell, where no route of departure could be laid out, and
where there would be military security.</p>

<p>We discussed that. It was my opinion that his best movement was to move
directly to Love Field. In fact, the routes would not be available anyway,
because this was not a schedule&mdash;the departure from the hospital to the field
would not be covered, if that were a possibility. And that it would be much
better if he got to the field immediately, where he was under security and got
aboard one of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any discussion about his taking the presidential plane,
AF-1, as opposed to AF-2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. There was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Vice President Johnson look to you in any way for a recommendation
on his subsequent plans in terms of your being then in charge of the
presidential party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. It was my impression that he did, that he, with the President
gone&mdash;that he felt I was&mdash;had to assume a position of responsibility, both with
regard to Mrs. Kennedy and as to himself. He asked me, as I recall&mdash;he asked
me for my advice as to his departure and used the words, "I am in your hands
now," at some point in the conversation.</p>

<p>But I did get the impression that he wanted official&mdash;that isn't the proper
word&mdash;but that his movements should be approved by all concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now related all the conversation you had at that
time with then-Vice President Johnson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. To the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Next after I left the Vice President, I went back to Mrs.
Kennedy. On the way through the lobby I noted the newspapermen were clamoring
for information. I met Kilduff. He said, "Should we announce it?" And
I said I think that is a decision that can only be made by the President "You
better ask him." So that was the last I saw of Kilduff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who is Kilduff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. He is the assistant press secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Malcolm Kilduff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Malcolm Kilduff.</p>

<p>I then went back to Mrs. Kennedy, who was in a very understandably distraught
condition. It was my opinion&mdash;I tried to in some way imply that she
might leave and come with us, at least to get her out of that room. She was
covered with blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which room was she in then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. She was in the same room. She had not moved. She was
sitting near the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is the room where the President was treated by the Dallas
doctors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes; there is a little corridor. There were swinging doors.
He was inside the swing door. She was not in the presence of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was her response to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Her response to me was she would not leave her husband's
body. At that point, I realized that she would not. The doctor had continually
attempted to get her to take some form of sedation. And she had consistently
refused, and told me she would not take anything, that she was going to stay
with her husband.</p>

<p>I realized that she was going to stay with her husband, no matter what anybody
did, and there was no possible way of in any way getting her to leave. And
so, therefore, the only alternative I could see was that we move the President.
It is an assumption I probably would have arrived at anyway, but I arrived at it
in this manner.</p>

<p>So I went out and got hold of Dr. Burkley and General McHugh, and one of
the agents, and Andy Berger, as I recall, and told them to get a casket, to bring
it back, and Dr. Burkley would have the doctors prepare the body for removal,
and that we would proceed to the airport and go to Washington.</p>

<p>This was done very rapidly, as I recollect. It seems to me it wasn't more
than half an hour that they arrived with the casket. I remember just before
they arrived I got Dave Powers and said there was a little room in the back
that we ought to just take Mrs. Kennedy under some subterfuge, and talk to
her in the room while we brought the casket in, because I thought that might
be the final blow. And we did, and&mdash;but she knew what was going on. She came
out and said, "No, I want to watch it all." And she stood in the doorway, and
thanked us for our attempt at being compassionate.</p>

<p>And then they took it in, and put the body in the casket.</p>

<p>We were then all prepared to go. The agents told me the ambulance was
ready, and they were prepared to move.</p>

<p>We&mdash;the casket was brought out about halfway, and a gentleman arrived who
said that we would not be allowed to remove the body from the hospital until
the necessary papers had been signed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't recollect who he was. I think he was&mdash;maybe from
the coroner's office. My assumption is he would be.</p>

<p>But he took this position. We asked&mdash;I don't recollect who transmitted the
message&mdash;that they speed this up as much as possible, and give us some idea how
long it took to accomplish this. And they went out into this other little room
where there were some telephones, and proceeded to call whoever it was necessary
to call to get this permission.</p>

<p>We waited about 10 or 15 minutes, and Dr. Burkley and General McHugh were
in the room, and Mr. O'Brien at some time. I went out again and asked them if
they had an answer, and nobody seemed to be able to answer the question as to
how long it might take, and whether it was a week or an hour.</p>

<p>So I was getting more concerned about Mrs. Kennedy's state all the time&mdash;although
she appeared composed, as she had from the beginning.</p>

<p>Then a gentleman did arrive who has later been identified for me as a Judge
Brown, who was on the telephone calling someone. It had been my assumption
that upon his arrival that he had the power to permit us to depart. Dr. Burkley
was talking to him in a very agitated manner. And the gentleman was very
calm and cool and collected. If my recollection is clear, he said something to
the effect that as of now this was just a homicide case, and there were certain
things that had to be carried out, one of which I interpreted as an autopsy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was it, Mr. O'Donnell, if you recall, who said this was just
another homicide case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. My feeling is it was Brown, but I really would not be&mdash;in
the excitement of the moment, the discussion of the autopsy, the signing of a
certificate from the hospital, and the treatment of this as a homicide case, I
would not want to be unfair and misinterpret who might have said it.</p>

<p>My recollection is it was indicated to us that the President is dead, the hospital
has to perform certain functions, and the law must be met, no matter who
it is, at this moment. In my own mind, when they said autopsy, I realized we
were talking not about hours, but perhaps even days, which was an impossible
situation for Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>I talked to Dr. Burkley, and had him suggest to them that they could have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
doctor come with us, he could accompany the body at all times, and that we
would bring him immediately to the Naval Hospital, and that they could perform
whatever necessary chores, and there would be no separation physically from the
hospital and the performance of their autopsy.</p>

<p>They refused to consider this.</p>

<p>I in my own mind determined that we had no alternative but to just depart.
So I went back in the room. I told Mr. O'Brien, and whoever else was assembled
there, that we were going to leave. I notified the Secret Service and General
McHugh, and told them to get ready to depart. We went in and took the body
out. Mrs. Kennedy stood right behind it, I think totally unaware of the problems
that were then existing, so perhaps confused as to the speed with which we were
attempting to depart.</p>

<p>We pushed the casket out through the hall. This first gentleman that had
come in, who, I presume, was from the coroner's office, shouted very loudly, "You
can't do that, you can't leave here now." Nobody paid any attention to him.
We pushed out through another set of swinging doors. I remember a Catholic
priest was between this and the doorway, and was praying. It was most disconcerting
because we were concerned at all times that some moment they would
say stop, and I hated to think what might happen to Mrs. Kennedy if she had
to go back and go through this all over again. So we brushed them all aside
and came out the same way we had come in, through the same doors.</p>

<p>There was an ambulance there. Andy Berger was seated in the driver's seat.
Several agents were there. The body was put into the ambulance, Mrs. Kennedy
got in with it. We climbed into a car alongside of it, and we took off for
the airport. I told the agents if they would signal ahead, that there were agents
at the airfield, and that as soon as we came through the gate, they were to close
the gate and let nobody else in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is the gate at the airfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall approximately what time you left the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I haven't the vaguest idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you have any idea how long it was after you arrived at
the hospital that you left the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I wouldn't&mdash;it was a couple of hours. But I wouldn't have
any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how long did the trip take you from the hospital back to
the airport?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I am guessing totally at time. I would think it seemed about
15 minutes. It wasn't a long period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What occurred then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The drive was uneventful. We went through the gate. We
arrived at the Air Force&mdash;I didn't know whether it was 1 or 2, to be honest,
until I saw the members of the crew. And they unloaded the casket. I remember
they had a very, very difficult time getting it up, because of the narrowness
of the ramp. It was very difficult for the Secret Service. It seemed at
moments it might almost tumble; it was frightening.</p>

<p>We got on the plane. And the seats had been taken out on the left side, so
they could lay the casket down. The casket was placed down. I told General
McHugh to tell the pilot to take off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether or not President Johnson had been
sworn in at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. At that time I didn't know President Johnson was on the
plane. I did not know whether he had been. Subsequently I realized he had not
been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any specific discussion, to your knowledge, or consideration,
to your knowledge, of holding the Presidential plane until Mrs.
Kennedy and President Kennedy's body arrived on that plane before departing
for Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. There has been no discussion of that to my knowledge. Once
the President&mdash;the Vice President left, I left him, I had not seen him again. I
had been notified he had departed, I had been notified that he arrived, and that
was the last I heard of it, until I got on the airplane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next, after arriving on the airplane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. As I say, I told General McHugh to have the plane take off,
still all of us under the assumption or apprehension that at some moment we
either might not be granted clearance to take off, or that the hospital may have
in some way gotten the police to intercept us&mdash;the difficulty of that to Mrs.
Kennedy was incalculable. I was in a highly desperate strait to get that
airplane in the air and back to Washington. As I say, I told General McHugh
to tell the pilot to take off.</p>

<p>There was a delay of 2 or 3 minutes, and nothing happened. So I headed up
for the cockpit myself, and I ran into McHugh in the meantime who said that
President Johnson was aboard, and that he had ordered the pilot to delay, to
hold up until he was sworn in. That was the first I knew he was aboard.</p>

<p>I would like to correct that. I must have known he was aboard, because I
am sure he must have greeted Mrs. Kennedy as she came aboard. And he and
Mrs. Johnson. But I don't have a clear recollection of that in my own mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present when President Johnson was sworn in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After you arrived back on AF-1, what did you do between that
time and the time the plane was airborne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Mrs. Johnson took Mrs. Kennedy into the President's room
on <i>Air Force 1</i>. I remember she was reluctant to even go in there, but she
persuaded her to. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was reluctant to go in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Mrs. Kennedy. And I went up, and the President and I
carried on a conversation, which, again my recollections might be hazy&mdash;that
it had been brought to his attention that I had asked for the plane to take off,
and that there was some difference of opinion between him and me. He said to
me that he had called the Attorney General, and that the Attorney General
had indicated that it was, if not mandatory, at least preferable that he be sworn
in prior to the aircraft taking off. I didn't describe what I saw as the problems.
I realized it was an inevitable delay. So I don't believe I commented on it.
I just listened to him. We sat there.</p>

<p>I went up and talked to the pilot, to make sure they didn't let anybody on
the plane, or put the ramps down for anybody, except the judge, under any
circumstances. About 10 or 15 minutes later the judge arrived and the swearing
in occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How soon after the swearing in was the plane airborne, if you
recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. It was almost immediate&mdash;as soon as he was sworn in,
the plane taxied out and took off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the return flight to Washington, where did you sit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I sat with Mrs. Kennedy almost all the way. We came
back&mdash;Mr. Powers, Mr. O'Brien, and I stayed in the back compartment. And
then Mrs. Kennedy and I&mdash;I sat down with her, we sat that way all the way
back. The President called me up on one or two occasions and asked me to
stay up in the cabin, wanted to talk to me, but I felt I had to stay with Mrs.
Kennedy. So I sat with her the whole trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you talk about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We reminisced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did she have anything to eat on the trip back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. No; I think we both had a drink. I tried to get her to take
a good strong drink. I had not much luck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. She drank part but not all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. As I recollect, she just wanted to talk. She talked all the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do then after your arrival in Washington, D.C.?
Or did you come back to Andrews Air Force Base?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We arrived at Andrews and meanwhile the Attorney General
had been notified, the decision had been made that he would go to Bethesda.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who made that decision, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That the autopsy should be performed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't think she knew anything about an autopsy. The
question is where the body went. We didn't tell her there was to be an autopsy.
And the choice was Walter Reed or Bethesda. He being a Navy man, she picked
Bethesda.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. She chose Bethesda, as between Bethesda and Walter Reed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. She did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who made the decision there would be an autopsy, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't know who made the decision. I just think we all
agreed&mdash;we arrived at Bethesda. The Attorney General was there. I think it
was just our assumption that this was a necessary part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you get from Andrews Air Force Base to Bethesda
Naval Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. By car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time did you arrive at Andrews, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't remember. It was dark. That is all I do recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how long was the car trip from Andrews to Bethesda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would think 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do after your arrival at Bethesda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. When we arrived at Bethesda, we went immediately to some
room, reception room, where the family was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We stayed there, I would think, until 3 or 4 in the morning.
We wanted to stay there until Mrs. Kennedy got back to the house.</p>

<p>We drove back to the White House with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time did you leave her at the White House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would think 4 or 5 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After that, did you go home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who all was present with the family at Bethesda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. There was Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Powers&mdash;I don't recollect anybody
else outside the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who from the family was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. As I remember, Jean Kennedy, the Attorney General and his
wife, I think Pat and Eunice. There were some other people. Really there
were two&mdash;there was one room inside, in which they were in, and there was one
out in the reception.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was on the balance of the itinerary in Texas after the
planned luncheon at the Trade Mart at Dallas on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. We were leaving Dallas and going to Austin, and Governor
Connally had arranged one or two receptions, and then a large dinner in the
evening, a fundraising dinner, and then the President was going to depart from
there to the Vice President's ranch, and stay with them through Saturday, and
then come back to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the estimated time of arrival at the LBJ Ranch about
10 p.m., on the evening of November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. That would be about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With the plan then being to depart for Washington on the 23d,
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the President's attitude, in a general way, about
Presidential protection&mdash;that is, President Kennedy's attitude about Presidential
protection, Mr. O'Donnell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, his general attitude was that the Secret Service&mdash;that
there was no protection available to a President of a democracy such as the
United States from a demented person who was willing to risk his own life; that
if someone wanted to kill a President of the United States, who in a sense wears
two hats&mdash;he is the leader of a political party as well as our Chief Executive&mdash;and
by the nature of our system must mingle with crowds, must ride through
our cities, and must expose himself to the American people&mdash;that the Secret
Service would not be, other than the protection that they provide by the screening
processes prior to the actual carrying out of a political trip&mdash;would not be
able to guarantee 100 percent protection, considering one has to mingle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
crowds of 50,000 or 100,000 people, and mingle with them at handshaking
distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you ever discussed the dangers inherent in a motorcade,
for example, with the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Not specifically in a motorcade. I don't think the President's
view was&mdash;very frankly, we had discussed this general subject. We
used to go on trips, and sit around in the evening and this would come up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the President's view expressed during those
conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. His view was that a demented person who was willing to
sacrifice his own life could take the President's life. And that if it were to
happen, I think his general view was it would happen in a crowded situation.
I don't think it entered his mind that it might happen in the fashion as of a
motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his reaction to that risk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I think he felt that was a risk which one assuming the office
of the Presidency of the United States inherited. It didn't disturb him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was the last conversation that you had with him on that
general topic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The last conversation I had with him on that general topic
was the morning of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did the conversation occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. The conversation took place in his room, with Mrs. Kennedy
and myself, perhaps a half hour before he left the Hotel Texas to depart for
Carswell Air Force Base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That was in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. That was in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And tell us, as nearly as you can recollect, exactly what he
said at that time, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Well, as near as I can recollect he was commenting to his
wife on the function of the Secret Service, and his interpretation of their role
once the trip had commenced, in that their main function was to protect him
from crowds, and to see that an unruly or sometimes an overexcited crowd did
not generate into a riot, at which the President of the United States could be
injured. But he said that if anybody really wanted to shoot the President of
the United States, it was not a very difficult job&mdash;all one had to do was get a
high building some day with a telescopic rifle, and there was nothing anybody
could do to defend against such an attempt on the President's life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was Mrs. Kennedy's reaction to that philosophy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I think&mdash;I think she had not quite thought of this at all.
She certainly had not thought of it in this way. But I think the general tenor
of the conversation was that she agreed that this was&mdash;in this democracy, this
is inherent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What had her reaction been to the trip to Texas up to that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. She had enjoyed it. She had not been a girl who had loved
campaigning. And I thought at the moment, at that very minute, that for the
first time&mdash;the President and I were discussing a forthcoming trip to the west
coast, and he had asked her if she would come, and she said she would be
delighted to come, and she would like to go from now on.</p>

<p>The President was delighted. We were all delighted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had she been on any political trip before this trip to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. No; she had not been on a political trip with us for quite
awhile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was the trip immediately prior to the one to Texas that
she was last on, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I don't recall. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it during the 1960 campaign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. She was pregnant, as I recollect, during the 1960 campaign.
She had been pregnant just prior to this. So that&mdash;and most of the other trips
had been really the sort of thing that was difficult for Mrs. Kennedy to go on.
But she had never evidenced to me quite as much interest in going on a&mdash;continuing
to go on these trips, as she was after this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had she ever been to Texas prior to November 21, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. Not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After the assassination, has she ever made any comment to
you about that conversation which you had in the Hotel Texas in Fort Worth
on the morning of November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I have never dared bring that conversation up to Mrs.
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. O'Donnell, do you have any knowledge, aside from the factors
which you have set forth during your testimony today, concerning anyone
involved in the shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. No; I have no comment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say you have no knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I have no knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think would be helpful
to the President's Commission in any way in its job of investigating all factors
relating to the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. One other detail, Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>Did you have occasion to deal with an particular individuals from the city
of Dallas itself during this trip, or in preparation for this trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. O'Donnell, under our practice, if you care to, we can make
this transcript available to you to read and to sign.</p>

<p>Would you prefer that, or would you just as soon waive the signature, and
have the transcript in its final form as it comes from the court reporter here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>. I would like to read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine. We will make it available to you for reading and signature,
sir. Thank you very much.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t457">TESTIMONY OF LAWRENCE F. O'BRIEN</h2>

<p>The testimony of Lawrence F. O'Brien was taken at 11 a.m., on May 26, 1964,
at the White House Office, Washington, DC., by Mr. Francis W.&nbsp;H. Adams,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Raise your right hand, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in this deposition
proceeding before the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Mr. O'Brien, the purpose of this deposition is to get from you
your knowledge of the facts surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy
on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>I would like to start way back, if I may, at the point of the conception of the
trip, the origin of the trip. How far back was that before November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. My recollection is the contemplation of the trip to Texas was
back some, perhaps, months before the actual trip.</p>

<p>However, I should quickly add that many discussions took place about potential
trips to all parts of the country at some future time, to some degree in the political
context. The President, No. 1, enjoyed getting out to meet the people; and,
secondly, over a period of time we had anticipated the President would travel
rather extensively when the opportunity presented itself. But the difficulty in
pinning anything like that down specifically in advance is the obvious difficulty
of scheduling any travel by the President, because of the duties of the office
and the obvious day to day changes in the problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. But you, yourself, were concerned and involved in discussions
looking towards this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; Mr. O'Donnell was responsible for the handling of the specifics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
of trips. He would engage in discussions with the President and projections
of possible trips of one sort or another. In his role as Appointments
Secretary, of course, he was constantly discussing with the President invitations
of all kinds that came across his desk.</p>

<p>The Vice President had expressed an interest for some time in a possible
trip to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Had he expressed that interest to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't recall specifically. It became generally understood in
our discussions that he was interested, the President was interested, Mr.
O'Donnell was charged with the responsibility of maintaining a day to day
relationship in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. At that time, what was your official title?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Special Assistant to the President for Congressional Relations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. A trip of this nature, as many trips within the United States,
would involve the inclusion of Members of Congress, appropriate members of
the delegation, and what-have-you. So that would be pretty much my involvement
in any arrangements for a trip of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. To put it another way, you did not yourself have the responsibility
for the specific planning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And were you involved in making&mdash;in the discussions which led
to the final decision about this Texas trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. There were some discussions that involved me as to the specific
stops on the trip, because there immediately you would have the matter of the
congressional districts that would be involved in the stops, and matters of that
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you happen to know how it came to pass that Mrs. Kennedy
went along on that trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I do not. I think Mr. O'Donnell would be the proper person
to direct that to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did you have anything to do with the security or protection
arrangements for the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Neither on that trip nor at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. This didn't come within your duties at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, is it fair to say that the substantial purpose of this trip
was political?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would not say&mdash;in my belief it was not the substantial purpose.
An invitation that had been extended by the Congressman Albert Thomas'
dinner committee, and I assume arrangements that were appropriate for that
time for a dinner in Austin contributed to the decision on that particular time
for this trip. This would be typical of the situation, as I recall it, where you
knew there would be an occasion when the President would visit Texas.</p>

<p>He was interested in visiting Texas, as he was other sections of the country.
And this sort of fell into line. It presented to some degree an opportunity to
make the trip at that time.</p>

<p>He was particularly fond of Congressman Thomas. And he had had a close-working
relationship with him in the Congress.</p>

<p>I, of course, became very well acquainted with Congressman Thomas, because
of my role representing the White House with the Congress. And I am sure
that was a contributing factor. He was most interested in attending this dinner
to honor him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I suppose it would be fair to say that almost any activity of the
President is in some measure political.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would say that is perhaps true.</p>

<p>But he had been interested, also, in having an opportunity to visit the Space
Center particularly. And he had watched the development of the space activity
in Texas with great interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, going back to the time that you left Washington on that
trip, did you leave with the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. From the White House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. By helicopter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And what was the time&mdash;do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. It was approximately forenoon, about 10:45, from the White
House lawn, in the President's helicopter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And where did you go in the helicopter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. We went to Andrews Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And did you go onboard <i>Air Force 1</i>?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And you went from there to Austin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. We went from there to San Antonio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I am sorry. I misspoke myself. San Antonio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Arriving in San Antonio about when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I think you would have to refer to the record on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Some time early afternoon? Some time in the afternoon of
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; I remember it was, weatherwise, an uneventful trip.
The weather was fine. There is no reason to suggest we didn't arrive at pretty
much the established time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then, just briefly, what happened in San Antonio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Well, there was a motorcade in San Antonio to the Aerospace
Center for a ceremony. And, as I recall, the ceremony was relatively brief.
The President spoke briefly. And then he inspected the installation.</p>

<p>The overall elapsed time I don't recall&mdash;perhaps an hour or an hour and
a half.</p>

<p>And then we proceeded back to the airport for the trip to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. What happened in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. In Fort Worth, as I recall, at the airport there was&mdash;from
the airport into the hotel in Fort Worth, it was rather a lengthy trip. It also
involved crowds at various stops.</p>

<p>The hour&mdash;I am sorry I cannot recall the hour of arrival&mdash;but it was, as
we say, an offbeat hour. It was rather surprising to have the interest shown
crowdwise as we went in. It delayed the motorcade into the hotel and outside
of the hotel there was a large crowd of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. What was the reaction of that crowd? Was that a friendly
group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would describe it as friendly; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then what happened next, after you arrived at the hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. The President and his party checked into the hotel for the
night. I do not recall any other official activity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And what happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Well, the following morning the President arose early to attend
a breakfast. As I recall, it was a civic breakfast, sponsored by the local civic
group or groups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did Mrs. Kennedy attend that, also, as you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. She arrived at the breakfast, as I recall, following the President.
The President spoke at the breakfast, and received gifts, and Mrs. Kennedy
received a gift. I recall one of the gifts to the President was a Stetson. I
recall that he did not try it on, but he appreciated receiving it.</p>

<p>Following the breakfast, he then spoke to a large crowd in front of the hotel,
in the parking area opposite the hotel. There had been indications of bad
weather. There was some rain, and then the rain became intermittent.</p>

<p>Upon completing his speech in the parking area, he returned upstairs to
await the normal departure time.</p>

<p>When that time arrived, I went downstairs ahead of the President and Mrs.
Kennedy, and the Secret Service were determining whether or not they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
have the top up or down on the car, because there was still an occasional
drop of rain. However, a few minutes elapsed, and it appeared the weather
would stay good for the drive to the airport. So he left, to the best of my
recollection&mdash;I feel sure of this&mdash;in an open car to the airport from the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. While we are on that subject, just to digress for a moment, what
was his attitude toward riding in open cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. It was certainly his preference. He had always expressed
a view that in our democracy a President should, whenever possible, be exposed
to the people. And I think, also, he felt the people should be exposed to him.
He always wanted to have the closest possible contact with people. And in
that context his preference certainly at all times was an open car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And these preferences were expressed to you personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Not in the context of this particular situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No; I mean through the years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. But certainly we were totally aware of his desires in that area.
And this had, of course, been his position not only in the United States but in
trips outside the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did he have&mdash;did he ever happen to express any particular view
to you about motorcades, in terms of security?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I cannot recall any discussion I had with him in that
regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Generally speaking, what was his position as expressed to you
about security?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I cannot recall any specific conversation in that area. There
may have been. But certainly it was not of sufficient substance to be of any
importance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. More specifically, did you ever discuss with him the possibility
of assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did you ever discuss it with Mrs. Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Well, I took you off the track there. We will come back to Fort
Worth, now, if we may.</p>

<p>When we left we were discussing his concluding his talk and going out to the
airport in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; there were, as I recall it, some bands en route. There
was a great deal of excitement, enthusiasm. The weather had cleared. And
it was a thoroughly pleasant trip out to the airport. The President obviously
enjoyed it.</p>

<p>When we arrived at <i>Air Force 1</i>, he commented that that certainly had been
a very interesting and pleasant morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And you went with him on <i>Air Force 1</i>?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. To Dallas&mdash;arriving late in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would estimate our arrival time at Dallas perhaps around
11:45. I know that we anticipated the motorcade through the streets of Dallas
at the noon hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did you yourself have anything to do with the planning of that
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. With the exception of insuring the inclusion in the motorcade
of the Members of Congress and Senator Yarborough, that they be properly
handled so that they would be included in open cars in the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And it was part of your responsibility to see that&mdash;what cars
they got into and all those arrangements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would not say specifically that. They would have their car
assignments. But for the most part, it was, if anything went wrong in the
arrangements at some point, I would then be able to have a staff man correct it.
So I would keep a close eye on the congressional people traveling with the
President on a trip of that nature to be sure that they were well taken care of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you know when the information about the precise route was
released to the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Was there any thought&mdash;I withdraw that one, and ask you this:
Do you know how it came about that Dallas was chosen as one of the cities
to visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't recall specifically, except that the size of the city, the
concentration of population, would make it an obvious stop in Texas, if you were
going to be in the State for 2 or 2½ days. It is rather an obvious decision,
that the Dallas area would be one of the stops.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. As far as you know, there was never any consideration given
to omitting Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I do not recall any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Well, we are back now at Love Field. Would you tell us what
happened there, as far as you observed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. The President moved over to the fence, where a large crowd
had gathered and shook the hands of several in the crowd, as the motorcade
was awaiting his departure. All those in the motorcade proceeded to get into
their cars. There was the usual amount of minor confusion&mdash;people hustling
around to locate their car number, and I stood watching the President engaged
in this activity, until he had gotten into his car, and a quick observation indicated
to me that all those traveling with us had gotten into their cars.</p>

<p>I came very close, however, to being left at Love Field, because I delayed
a little longer than I normally would, observing the scene, and, consequently,
I had to make a little dash, myself, to hop into a car, to insure that I would
travel into town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. When the President was greeting people along the fence there,
was he accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And do you recall at that time what the Vice President and
Mrs. Johnson were doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. They were engaged in the same activity, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I think you said this was a large crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; it appeared to be a large crowd. The difficulty in judging
a crowd from the ground at an airport is obvious. But as we came down the
steps of the plane, looking out over the crowd, I had the impression that it was
a large crowd for an airport stop, considering the fact the President was about
to travel through the heart of the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Was it a friendly crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. It appeared to be friendly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, getting to the motorcade, what was its organization, as
you recall it, in terms of what cars at what places?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. As I recall it, following the usual police grouping in the front
and sides, the President's car, Secret Service car, the Vice President's car, additional
Secret Service car, wire service cars&mdash;I would think there probably were
two&mdash;the VIP cars followed, and then following those cars, which was rather a
long line of them, as I recall, were, I believe, one or two buses containing the
press, traveling press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. When you refer to the VIP cars, those would include the Congressmen
and the other gentlemen you referred to before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is right. Senator Yarborough was in the car with the
Vice President and Mrs. Johnson. The members of the congressional delegation
traveling with us at that point were then in open cars&mdash;I would think there were
perhaps four open cars to accommodate them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Which one were you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I was in one of those open cars&mdash;specifically, I don't remember
the order of the car, but I remember the passengers I joined. And as I pointed
out, this was rather a quick hop into the car that I made at that point. Congressman
Mahon was in the front seat with the driver. Congressman Rogers of
Texas, now Judge Homer Thornberry of Texas, and me in the back seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you know who the driver was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I do not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, would you say that between you and the Vice President's
followup car, there was more than one open car? As I get it&mdash;to put it another
way to perhaps refresh your recollection&mdash;there was the Vice President's car,
then there was a followup car behind that, and then came, as you have recalled,
the open cars, in which you were seated in one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, were you in the one directly behind the Vice President's
followup car, or farther back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I do not believe I was in the first VIP car, because, as I stated
when I looked around and the motorcade started to move slightly, I moved
toward a car handy to me. I would think that I was in the second or conceivably
third open car, because, at that time, we had approximately 10 or
12 members of the Texas congressional delegation, and obviously we, therefore,
had perhaps four open cars. I don't recall that I was in the first one&mdash;it was
the second or third. I was not in the last one, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Were you assigned to a particular car, or would you just have
taken any that would happen to be available?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I am sure I was assigned to a particular car. As a rule, I
would be assigned to the first VIP car&mdash;VIP meaning as a rule, again, a congressional
delegation. And in this instance, I don't recall the actual car assignment.
And it was not unusual for me to not adhere strictly to the assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And as the motorcade left Love Field&mdash;let me withdraw that and
put it this way: You were seated in the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. On the right back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. On the right-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. From where you were seated in that car, as you proceeded toward
the city, could you see the President in his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Only occasionally. There were occasions when you could not
see him. Other times, depending on the turns in the road, and what-have-you,
you would get a view of him. And there were times when he was upright in the
car, and you could spot him.</p>

<p>But, generally speaking, I would say that I was concentrating on crowd
attitude and size for the most part, going in toward the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. From what you could see of the President's car, where was he
seated?</p>

<p>On the right-hand side or the left-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. As I looked toward the car, he was seated on the right, with
Governor Connally seated directly in front of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That is right. And Mrs. <span class="locked">Connally&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Mrs. Connally on the jump seat in front of Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. As the motorcade proceeded, could you at all times see the Vice
President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; similarly, the photographers and others would often times
block the view. The view of the President's car and the Vice President's car
from where I was seated during the motorcade into and through the downtown
Dallas was not a clear view. There was an obstructed view for the most part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. As you recall it, what were the seating arrangements in the Vice
President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I know that Senator Yarborough, Mrs. Johnson, and the Vice
President were seated in the rear of the car, and my recollection is that again
the Vice President was on the right, Mrs. Johnson in the middle, Senator Yarborough
on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, as you went on in town, tell me about the crowds, if you
would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. The crowds were large, unusually large for an extremely long&mdash;mileagewise&mdash;long
trip into the city. I was impressed with the size of the crowd.
The comment in our car, however, was that the crowd was rather reserved. As a
matter of fact, Congressman Rogers, who, as I told you, was on the left rear,
commented and called out from time to time in a jocular vein, "Hello", "Howdy",
and suggested to them that they ought to smile and look perky, which we felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
they were not doing during the course of the trip from the airport to the outskirts
of the business area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Up to that point, I suppose it was chiefly residential areas that
you passed through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. It seemed to be residential, and a great deal of small industry.
The crowd looked to me to be middle to upper class business type to a great
extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did you know the city of Dallas yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Had you been there before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then as you got into the city, what was the nature of the crowds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. There was a tremendous change in crowd attitude, which, again,
we commented on in the car. It seemed as though it occurred suddenly, but yet
nevertheless in retrospect it did grow as you approached the business center.
Then you found yourself going down a road, on both sides high buildings, confetti,
the crowds out in the street, allowing just a narrow lane for the motorcade.
And I would have to describe that crowd as enthusiastic. In fact, perhaps I
should say wildly enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you remember any special incidents of any kind on the way
into town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. On rare occasion you saw a Goldwater sign, or some sign of that
nature, conservative sign, I guess, but not many. It was not an unusual situation,
as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you remember the motorcade stopping at anytime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I recall the motorcade stopping, and it seems to me it was for the
purpose of the President greeting some school children. However, I am not clear
in my mind. I do recall a slowdown or an actual stopping on at least one occasion,
and perhaps more than one occasion, between the airport and downtown
Dallas. And I should add that those in the car in which I rode, to a man, commented
on the great enthusiasm of the crowds in downtown area. I think they
were making reference to it particularly because there was somehow or other&mdash;we
all concluded this was a comparison that could be made with the crowds we
had just gone by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you recall the motorcade passing down Main Street in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And then do you recall it turning off Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And then around onto Elm Street? You might not remember the
names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't recall the name of the street. But I recall distinctly a
right turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And then another swerving turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. At that point, were there a lot of buildings or only a few?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. It seemed that when we made the turn off the Main Street, that
the crowds petered out. It was a very normal termination of a parade route.
And we just felt that while there were people on the streets, it was not the massive
crowd that we had just passed over several blocks. And I believe that my
reaction was this is about the end of the parade route, and we were about to
just sort of settle back. There were people still on the street, but you could
see that this route was&mdash;this parade route was about to terminate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And as you came around those turns, did you hear any shots
fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Would you tell me as best you can whether at that time you could
see the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Was that because your car had not turned the corner yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. As I recall, our car was about to make that turn, and it would
seem to me, therefore, the President's car was in the process of making the left
turn. I would think that approximately the time he was swinging on this curving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
left, we were swinging out of Main Street right. We heard the shots very
clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Can you estimate for me the time interval between the first and
the last shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't believe I can estimate the timing, but I can tell you
about an exchange that took place in the car, from the first shot through the
third shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Please do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. The first shot was fired. I just didn't conclude it was rifle fire.
I was completely unsure. And I must have almost immediately said to the
driver&mdash;I directed the question to him, for some unknown reason&mdash;"What was
that?" The driver replied, "I do not know. They must be giving him a 21-gun
salute." By the time the driver had concluded that sentence, we did not hear
explosion No. 4. And it was apparent to us that No. 1 was not a 21-gun salute.
I believe everyone in the car concluded it wasn't, in any event, because it just
was not that kind of a sound. And we just had no idea of what had occurred
at that moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Could you tell me your best recollection as to where the sounds
appeared to come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I didn't have any idea specifically on the location of the sounds,
and I do not recall that anyone in the car did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Is it your recollection that these sounds were evenly spaced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is my impression. As I say, I apparently immediately
engaged the driver in conversation after the first shot which forces me to conclude
that there had to be a time between the first and second and third shots&mdash;because
I simply&mdash;describing the exchange of my question and his answer, and
his answer, I must say, probably was completed after the third shot. But he
had started his answer to the question at about or just before the third shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Well, one way of getting at the time interval of all three shots,
I suppose, would be your recollection that it all was encompassed in the time it
took you to ask the question and the driver to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. At least in the time that it took me to ask the question and the
driver to initiate the answer, but perhaps not complete it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then would it be fair to say it was a very small number of seconds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. It certainly would be. And I think the driver completed his
answer&mdash;for 1 or 2 seconds all of us in the car were awaiting the fourth explosion,
if I can term it that, which did not occur, and there was dead silence in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then do you remember anything that anyone said immediately
following the dead silence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I do not recall. I recall that just prior to this, which indicates
to me that perhaps we had turned that corner before the shots, Judge Thornberry
pointed to a building and said that that was where his offices had been
located at one time, either in military service or in government service, and
pointing over in the direction of the building. We were turning the corner&mdash;and
that took place before the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. You don't happen to know the name of that building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't recall. But he mentioned it in the term that he had been
stationed in that building. Now, it could have been either a military activity
or in government agency activity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. How did the knowledge come to you that the President had been
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. We noted, as the cars continued to move after the third shot,
and there was a great deal of movement on both sides in front of us, scurrying
in various directions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Scurrying by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. People on the street&mdash;the crowds had thinned out. There were
people along the road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. We didn't specifically cover this, but was there a motorcycle
escort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. For the motorcade?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes; around the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did that motorcycle escort extend as far back as your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; it did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I interrupted you there. You were telling me how this knowledge
came to you, that something serious had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't think even up to that point, as the motorcade started
to move out in front of us, as each car seemed to move out from great speed, we
were at all aware of&mdash;certainly we had no idea of the specific nature of the
occurrence. And we just were, I think you would have to describe, very confused.
I remember particularly a Negro man with a youngster in his arms running
up the slope of the lawn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. On which side of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. On the right. And that was typical of all kinds of movement,
as we tried to determine what had occurred, and we just didn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did you have any radio communication in your car with the
front cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; we did not. At that point, a photographer&mdash;we started to
move a little more rapidly. Our driver intended to follow the motorcade and
move out. The motorcade moved out with great speed in front of us. And a
photographer jumped on the trunk of our car&mdash;it was a convertible&mdash;holding
onto the edge of the seat, and pounding his fist on the trunk, and obviously in a
most excited state. We did not get anything coherent from him. I do not think
we really attempted to, because at that point, as he hung onto our car, obviously
to try and keep up with the motorcade himself, our car moved out with great
speed.</p>

<p>The driver lost sight of the car in front of him in a matter of two or three
minutes. He had no idea where the motorcade was headed. And they, therefore,
proceeded to take us directly along the highway, passed the trade mart, which
was to be the location of the President's stop and speech following the parade
route.</p>

<p>We pulled up in front of the motorcade, slowed down, and someone called out,
He has been shot, he is draped over the back seat. And at that point the
driver concluded that perhaps his destination should be the nearest hospital.
And he started to move out with great speed toward this hospital. And as we
came closer to it, it became obvious that that was our destination, because then
you saw the cars, the motorcycle police, and what-have-you. As we arrived at the
hospital, there was a great deal of commotion at the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I think you misspoke yourself. You said you pulled up in front
of the motorcade. I think perhaps you meant to say you pulled up in front of
the trade mart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Trade mart&mdash;I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, just to make it perfectly clear, did you see the President
or Governor Connally at the moment that they were shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. How long would you think it took you to go from the point where
you heard the shots to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would say overall it could approach 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And what was your estimate of the rate of speed of your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would say 60 to 70 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. When you arrived at the hospital, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. When I arrived at the hospital, two of the Congressmen that
had been in the motorcade, obviously, therefore, in a car ahead of my car, because
they had arrived, came over to the car as we pulled up, and asked me to follow
them immediately. There was a large crowd&mdash;I will correct that&mdash;there were
many people in front of the entrance to the hospital, and the entrance was being
guarded by police.</p>

<p>Congressman Thomas and Congressman Brooks went up to the officers at the
door and said, "This is a Special Assistant to the President. Let him in." So
he immediately opened the doors, and I went through, with the two Congressmen,
who asked a hospital attendant inside the corridor the direction in which
to go. There was a little confusion in the corridor as to direction, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
headed at first in the wrong direction, and were again rerouted. And in a
matter, however, of a couple of minutes from the entrance of the hospital, I
arrived behind these swinging doors with glass panels, and my first&mdash;I saw to
my right sitting&mdash;yes&mdash;sitting in a chair, and to my left, in this corridor sitting
in a similar chair&mdash;to my right Mrs. Kennedy, to my left Mrs. Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. You didn't go in through the emergency entrance, then? You
went <span class="locked">through&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Apparently not. I am not sure of the entrance. But I just
don't know. I assume that was not the emergency entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And you said that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Connally were sitting
there more or less together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No. They were sitting&mdash;obviously chairs had been placed outside
the door in each instant&mdash;one door to the left as you walked through these
swinging doors with the glass panels&mdash;one door to the left that was closed, one
door to the right that was closed. And outside of the door&mdash;this was a fairly
wide corridor that ran down perhaps through three rooms on each side, these
first two rooms right and left, the President had been placed in the emergency
room to the right and Governor Connally in the emergency room to the left.
Both doors were closed at that moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Was there anyone with Mrs. Kennedy at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Mr. Powers and Mr. O'Donnell were standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Were you accompanied all the way up to this point by the two
Congressmen you mentioned before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. The two Congressmen did not go through the doors with me.
They left me at some point several feet from the doors, when it was determined
that I was being taken to the right location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, at that point, you knew that&mdash;from the Congressmen and
from others, that the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then did you go up to Mrs. Kennedy or Mrs. Connally, or what
did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I immediately engaged Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Powers in conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Can you recall that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Neither Mr. Powers or Mr. O'Donnell had a clear idea of the
situation at the moment, but Mr. O'Donnell certainly gave me a positive indication
that there was little or no chance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did you have any conversation with Mrs. Kennedy at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I did not have any conversation other than attempting to comfort
her, asking her if there was anything we could do&mdash;brief moments of that
nature. But conversation was extremely limited.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you know where the Vice President was at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I did not see the Vice President in the hospital. I was given to
understand by Mr. O'Donnell he was down the corridor&mdash;again, if I did an about-face,
headed across in the other direction&mdash;that he was in a room across the
hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Until the President was taken from the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. You stayed there with Mrs. Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. During that whole time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is right. During that period General McHugh at one
point, Malcolm Kilduff from the press staff from time to time came in and
out, Mrs. Lincoln, Dr. Burkley came in and out from time to time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Was Dr. Burkley also in the emergency room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. As we stood there, they moved equipment, heavy emergency
equipment into the emergency room, and there was a great deal of what you
would just envision&mdash;scurrying around of nurses and doctors, a great deal of
activity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did you go into the emergency room yourself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Taking it from the point that you arrived there in the corridor
where Mrs. Kennedy was seated, how long a time passed before it came to
your knowledge that the President was dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I cannot recall the length of time I had with specific knowledge.
My impression is I had perhaps at the outset in the first seconds or minutes, I
had some doubt this had occurred.</p>

<p>I think perhaps what happened is that it penetrated, without a specific statement
by anyone. I just had to conclude this had occurred, and it became
obvious. At that point, however, Mr. Powers, Mr. O'Donnell, and I were not
at all sure that this had penetrated with Mrs. Kennedy for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you remember anything about a priest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; I do. I recall that Mr. O'Donnell told me that he had
asked the staff, or it might have been a Secret Service man, or hospital staff person&mdash;in
any event&mdash;someone to immediately secure a priest. There was no priest
on the premises. And he had assumed perhaps a priest was en route, because
by that time the knowledge that something serious had occurred certainly had
become known through police radio and what-have-you.</p>

<p>But the priest arrived in a relatively short time. I don't know the specific
time. But it didn't seem to be an awful long time. And, as a matter of fact,
my recollection is that a second priest arrived, and then a third priest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And you don't know who they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. During this interval, between the time that you arrived where
Mrs. Kennedy was seated and the time it was officially determined that the
President was dead, do you recall any conversation with Mrs. Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No conversation other than, "Is there anything we can do for
you?" Or a conversation of that nature in very brief and occasional sentences&mdash;no
conversation as such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did Mr. Powers stay with you all that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Mr. O'Donnell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did there come a time when Mr. O'Donnell left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Mr. O'Donnell, at one point we discussed the situation&mdash;and Mr.
O'Donnell at one point determined that he should cross the corridor and advise
the Vice President of what the situation appeared to be at that moment. And
as I recall, it was the conclusion that this was an extremely serious matter, we
hadn't any formal advice or official advice on the situation, but the seriousness
of it should be imparted to the Vice President.</p>

<p>He left briefly for that purpose, I assume, and returned to the position where
we had been standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. How did it come officially to your notice that the President was
dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Again, I just don't know. It was a matter of standing for
what seemed to be an interminable period of time&mdash;I have no idea the specific
time&mdash;and, again, I cannot recall a specific instance when an announcement
was made. It was more just finally having what gradually became obvious penetrate
with you, it was, that it was an actuality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. How was the fact conveyed to Mrs. Kennedy? Do you remember
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't remember a specific conversation by anyone with her.
People came to her, hospital staff people, doctors from time to time that would
lean down and whisper to her. I don't know whether at one of those occasions
this was specifically stated. I think, again, perhaps it was just gradually we
all came to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Well, at any rate, after the fact was&mdash;had, as you well put it,
had penetrated, what happened next, as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Our concern, in our discussions&mdash;Mr. O'Donnell and I discussed
what should be done. Our major concern was that obviously you just could
not leave Mrs. Kennedy sitting in this chair, drenched in blood. Something
certainly had to take place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
In that context, we felt steps should be taken to remove the President from
the hospital. And someone, either Mr. Powers or Mr. O'Donnell, had suggested
at one point during the several minutes, that Mrs. Kennedy might want to retire
to a room a couple of doors down the corridor. Our attempt to bring this about
was not successful, because she started to walk and then turned around and
said, "I want to stay with him." And she went back to the chair.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Donnell, at a point in these proceedings, issued the directions to the
Secret Service to secure a coffin. As I recall it, the coffin arrived in a very
reasonable time. Whoever handled those arrangements certainly did it&mdash;carried
out his responsibility well, because&mdash;again, time had a way of going on, and it
is hard to determine a matter of minutes. But the coffin arrived, in any event,
and was wheeled into the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did Mr. O'Donnell leave at this point&mdash;did he leave Mrs. Kennedy
and go somewhere else, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. He, as I recall, again, went to the room in which the Vice
President was waiting, to tell him specifically that the President had died,
and to discuss with him the steps to move the Vice President out of the hospital
and to the airport and on to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Did Mr. O'Donnell come back and tell you about that discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. He came back and told me that he had advised the President,
and he had had a discussion with the President. And I don't remember any
of the details of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That covered two basic points&mdash;that President Kennedy's body
was to be removed from the hospital forthwith, and the other was that the
Vice President was to return to Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. What were the reasons that led to the decision, if you know,
that the Vice President would return to Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I believe it was in the context of the death of the President,
what steps, if any, were necessary for the Vice President to assume the responsibility
of the office forthwith, and our great concern about the situation in
which Mrs. Kennedy was being left in this corridor, without any plan for taking
care of her. So I think the basic idea was to leave the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Was there any discussion as to whether there might or might
not be some general conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Not with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I must add, however, that during the course of this, that none
of us had any knowledge of actually what had occurred. And I am sure that
some of us gave thought to what might still occur. We just had no idea. And
we felt that certainly the first step was the protection of the new President
and the taking care of Mrs. Kennedy as best we could. We tried to give some
clarity of thoughts to the steps that were necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, you discussed these problems with Mr. O'Donnell and Mr.
Powers, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I will take you back to the point where the coffin arrived. What
happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. The coffin was wheeled into the emergency room. At that point,
a man arrived on the scene who, I assume, was the coroner, or someone representing
the coroner's office. I do not know his name. And he stated that the
President could not be taken from the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Was this in Mrs. Kennedy's presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I recall this conversation took place just outside those swinging
doors with the glass panels. And I would&mdash;I believe, therefore, that she did not
hear this conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, at the time the coffin was wheeled into the emergency room,
what did Mrs. Kennedy do? Did she enter at that time, or at any time, so far
as you recall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. My recollection is that she did enter the room, but I don't recall
it was at that time, and I am not sure what specific time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Well, going back to this official who said the body could not be
removed&mdash;you were present at that time with Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Powers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And what happened with respect to that discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Well, Dr. Burkley, the President's physician, entered into
that discussion. And as I recall he and this official went into a little room just
outside these doors and carried on further discussion that seemed to involve
members of the hospital staff and others. And the discussion went on for a
period of several minutes. Burkley&mdash;Dr. Burkley was quite exercised. It was
apparent that this fellow was not going to&mdash;he was going to be adamant in his
position. And very soon another official arrived on the scene that was described
to me as a judge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Does the name Brown refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't know as I heard his name. But he was then described
as the judge&mdash;a judge, and the indication was that he, therefore, was in a
higher position of authority than the other official that had been carrying on
this discussion with Dr. Burkley.</p>

<p>He was equally adamant. The reference was made, either specifically by him
or by someone in the official group, that this had to be treated as just another
homicide, and that no other&mdash;no special considerations could be given to the
problem. That, of course, increased our concern about Mrs. Kennedy, who
said she would not leave her husband, and that we could envision Mrs. Kennedy
in that state in the hospital for hours or even longer. So, therefore, it was our
determination that the President should be taken from the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. This was the determination of you, Mr. O'Donnell, and Dr.
Burkley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. The casket was brought out from the emergency room, wheeled
out through these two folding doors. And the members of the Secret Service
gathered around it. They had made a determination on their own as to the
exit. An ambulance was waiting. Preparations had been made by the Secret
Service to accomplish this. And we all&mdash;Mr. O'Donnell, Mr. Powers and I, General
McHugh, and two or three members of the Secret Service proceeded to push
the coffin down this corridor.</p>

<p>My recollection is that objections were still being raised by some or all
officials. My recollection is also that we paid little heed to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. These were vigorous objections, I gather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would say they were. And the only very minor problem that
occurred in reaching the exit was that the priest who was third in point of arrival
was still present. The other two priests had departed after expressing their
condolences to Mrs. Kennedy. But this priest was standing in the corridor
and was rather insistent that he formalize some prayers at that point. And I
suggested to him that he step aside. Our concern still was whether or not
there was going to be an effective block put in our way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And who accompanied Mrs. Kennedy at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I believe in the grouping behind the casket that at one time
Mr. O'Donnell, another time me, and another time perhaps Mr. Powers&mdash;but
among us we escorted her along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then when you finally got the casket out through this corridor,
and got it into the ambulance, how did you go to the airport?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. In a car that was parked alongside the ambulance. The driver
in the car&mdash;Mrs. Kennedy went into the ambulance. And Mr. O'Donnell, Mr.
Powers, and I went into the back seat of this car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Was this a police car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. It was an official car of some sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. At that time do you know whether or not the Vice President had
left the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Had he arrived at Love Field by the time you got out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And what happened when you arrived at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Well, again the Secret Service and those of us in the official
party that had arrived at the field&mdash;I guess specifically again the three of us&mdash;helped
to move the coffin up the steps of the plane. It was a difficult job,
because the steps, of course, were the normal set of stairs for a plane, and, therefore,
it was too narrow to accomplish this without some difficulty. But it was
brought onto the plane.</p>

<p>At that point I noticed that seats to the left of the door had been removed,
leaving a floor space in the plane to place the coffin. We placed the coffin on the
floor. Then I looked up, and the President and Mrs. Johnson were at the
corridor that would go into the compartment from that area of the plane.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy came aboard and was seated in the remaining two seats at a
table to the left in the rear compartment, and Mrs. Johnson and the President
went over to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you know how it came to pass that the President was sworn in
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. The President and Mrs. Johnson, after a brief discussion with
Mrs. Kennedy, went into the Presidential compartment&mdash;I guess that is the
best way to describe that section of the plane&mdash;this would be where the President's
chair and desk are located. He asked Mr. O'Donnell to join him.</p>

<p>During the course of these few minutes, it was my understanding that we were
going to immediately depart. There was some confusion for a couple of minutes
about departure. I was not privy to that. And the President asked the two
of us to sit with him, at which point he said that he was awaiting a judge who
was en route to swear him in&mdash;that he had secured the advice of the Attorney
General, which, as I understood it, was a preference in his view to have a swearing
in ceremony immediately. And that this would be accomplished within a
matter of minutes.</p>

<p>So while we awaited the arrival of the judge, the President, Mr. O'Donnell and
I, joined by Mrs. Johnson, after a couple of minutes, sat at this table with the
four seats, and just discussed the fact that the departure would take place immediately
following the swearing in ceremony. And during that period we
briefly discussed the first step of the President to insure continuity, and either
just before the swearing-in or immediately following it, the President discussed
with Mr. O'Donnell and me his desire that we stay, as he put it, shoulder to
shoulder with him.</p>

<p>The judge <span class="locked">arrived&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. During that interval, who was staying with Mrs. Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Mrs. Kennedy had at that point gone into the restroom adjacent
to the bedroom in the compartment.</p>

<p>The judge arrived in minutes. And it was suggested that those in the&mdash;I guess
the best way to describe it&mdash;the front of the plane, those who could move into
the compartment, including those representing the press, a single photographer
was brought aboard. The wording of the oath was available. The judge took
her position. The President said that he certainly wanted Mrs. Kennedy with
him at this moment. I went to the bedroom. The door to the adjoining restroom
was closed. I went out and asked Mrs. Lincoln if she would see if Mrs.
Kennedy was available. She went in and came out with Mrs. Kennedy, and she
took her place to the President's left, Mrs. Johnson to the President's right, the
others grouped around. I stood behind the judge, and just as the judge was to
start the ceremony, a member of the crew handed me a small Bible in a white box.
I took the Bible from the box, interrupted the judge just momentarily, and
handed her the Bible. She completed the ceremony.</p>

<p>Then everyone immediately settled down. The judge departed from the plane,
the photographer from the plane. Everyone settled down, and we took off without
further delay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. As a matter of detail, do you happen to know what happened to
the Bible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. The plane then departed immediately?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Mr. O'Donnell and I went to the rear compartment where we
joined Mr. Powers and General McHugh. Mrs. Kennedy was seated in one of
the two chairs. Mr. O'Donnell took the other chair. The three of us stood.
The plane took off. And we remained with Mrs. Kennedy for the duration of
the trip to Washington.</p>

<p>We consulted, or were consulted by General Clifton and Mr. Moyers on two
or three occasions during the trip, on arrangements for the President's activity
upon arrival here in Washington. One suggestion was made that we&mdash;that they
call in for a meeting of the White House staff. But that was discarded as impractical
at this point. Arrangements were made, however, which Mr. Moyers
checked with me, on the calling of the bipartisan leaders to a meeting with the
President, and arrangements were put in effect for the President to meet the
Under Secretary of State in the absence of the Secretary and other officials here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. How did it come about that the remains of President Kennedy
were taken to the naval hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. It was my understanding that the President would be taken to a
hospital. I don't recall any discussion of the reason specifically other than my
assumption that the autopsy would take place at one of the military hospitals
in Washington. And obviously there were two to select from, and the President
being an ex-Navy man, it seemed just sort of normal to suggest Bethesda.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And you remained with Mrs. Kennedy during the entire trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. What was her condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. She conversed a great deal with us. The one impression left
with me from the entire trip and conversations with Mrs. Kennedy during the
trip, participated in by all of us, was her great concern for us, really&mdash;her feeling
that we had, as she put it, been with him at the beginning and we were with him
at the end. We were all bereft. And I am afraid that the four of us who felt
that we should be of some comfort to her were inadequate to the job in the
sense that it was difficult for us to come up with anything that made much
sense by way of being helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you remember any other general subjects of discussion as you
made the trip up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. What happened when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. A lift was placed at the rear door of the plane. The honor
guard came up the front steps, through the plane, to the back compartment.
We concluded that we would take the body off the plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. You say "we." You mean Mr. Powers, Mr. O'Donnell, and
yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. General McHugh. And so we proceeded to do just that. We
took the&mdash;lifted the coffin, with the help of the crew people, and placed it on the
lift, and it was taken from there.</p>

<p>We&mdash;the three of us&mdash;four of us&mdash;McHugh was with us&mdash;got into a car.
The Attorney General and Mrs. Kennedy went into the ambulance, if that is
what it was. And we followed in a car directly behind that, went out to
Bethesda Naval Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. What did you do when you arrived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. We went immediately to an upper floor of the hospital, where
we joined members of the President's family. General McHugh went elsewhere.
And we then spent several hours in these rooms on, I don't know what
floor of the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. When you referred to the President's family, what particular
members were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Well, Mrs. Stephen Smith was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Mrs. Attorney General Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Yes. I don't recall all the members of the family. The Attorney
General&mdash;and there were&mdash;there was an occasional person that came and
went during the night But that was basically the group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
We had coffee and received reports from time to time from General McHugh
as to the length of time it would take for the trip from Bethesda to the White
House. And the hours went on and on, until the early hours of the morning&mdash;perhaps
4 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. We came to the White House, at which point several members
of the White House staff, Mr. Shriver, were awaiting the arrival of the President.
He was placed in the East Room. A brief prayer was given, and that
terminated the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I would like to ask you to go back again and give me your
recollections of the President's views about the nature of the protection that
should be afforded him, or what his attitude was towards security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I cannot recall any specific conversation I had with the President
in this area. All I can say is that the President at all times was most interested
in close contact with his fellow Americans, and in that sense he was
quick to move to a fence that separated him from the people, he was quick
to move towards people. He certainly moved quite freely. But I do not recall
ever having a conversation or being present during the course of a conversation
when the specific protective measures were discussed or what his views
were relative to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Other than what you have said here, do you have any knowledge
at all about the person who did the shooting, whoever it might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Do you have any other thing I have not covered that you would
like to put in this record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I don't believe so. I believe that to the best of my recollection
I have tried to carefully review all aspects of the matter, from departure from
the lawn of the White House to arrival back at the White House. And I cannot
call anything to mind now that I might have overlooked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Now, finally, it is a custom in this Commission to make transcripts
available to the witnesses if they want to read them before signing them, or
if you would like you can waive that. That is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I would like to have the transcript.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Then we will send it along in the next few days, and when you
have an opportunity to consider it, if you will just send it back to the Commission
we would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. I certainly will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That closes this deposition.</p>

<h2 id="t472">AFFIDAVIT OF DAVID F. POWERS</h2>

<p>The following affidavit was executed by David F. Powers on May 18, 1964.</p>

<p class="in0 right">
AFFIDAVIT</p>
<p class="in0">PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION<br />
ON THE ASSASSINATION OF<br />
PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">District of Columbia</span>, <i>ss</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>I, David F. Powers, make the following affidavit concerning my knowledge
of the events of November 21 and 22, 1963.</p>

<p>I traveled to Texas with the Presidential party on November 21, 1963, on AF-1.
After a stop in Houston, we spent the night in Fort Worth, Texas. On the
evening of November 21st, we were discussing the size of the crowd in the Rice
University Stadium at Houston, and the President asked me how I thought it
compared with the crowd the last time he was there. I said that the crowd
was about the same as the one which came to see him before but there were
100,000 extra people on hand who came to see Mrs. Kennedy. President Kennedy
then made a comment to Mrs. Kennedy to the effect that she was a great
asset on the trip and that seemed to make her happy, although at that particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
moment she was very tired, having spent many hours that day traveling in the
plane and on motorcades.</p>

<p>The next day we proceeded on to Dallas and arrived at Love Field at approximately
11:30 a.m. The President and Mrs. Kennedy were in high spirits and as
they were leaving the plane I jokingly remarked to the two of them that they
looked like Mr. and Mrs. America and that they should not both wave in the
same direction as it would be too much for anyone to receive all that attention
at once. They were the first to leave the Presidential plane (AF-1) and were
greeted by Vice President and Mrs. Johnson (whose plane had already arrived
at Dallas), along with other members of the Dallas reception committee. President
and Mrs. Kennedy then went over to greet the airport crowd which was
standing behind an iron fence. I was assigned to ride in the Secret Service automobile
which proceeded immediately behind the President's car in the motorcade.
That Secret Service follow-up automobile was an open car with two
Special Agents in the front seat, two Special Agents in the rear seat and two
Special agents on each of the two running boards. I sat in the jump seat on
the right side of the car and Kenneth O'Donnell sat in the jump seat on the left
side of the car.</p>

<p>The crowd in Dallas was very friendly and very enthusiastic. In my
opinion it was twice as large as the crowd that was present when Mr. Kennedy
campaigned in Dallas in 1960. Kenneth O'Donnell and I were observing the
size and disposition of the crowd in order to evaluate the local political situation.
President Kennedy was sitting on the extreme right-hand side of his automobile,
with his arm extending as much as two feet beyond the right edge of the
car, and Mrs. Kennedy was seated on the extreme left of the back seat. They
were seated at the opposite ends of the back seat in order to give their full attention
to the crowds on each side.</p>

<p>As we proceeded through Dallas the motorcade slowed down on a number of
occasions, but I do not believe it ever stopped. When we passed through the
heart of Dallas, the crowds were about ten deep. We then turned off of Main
Street onto Houston and made the sharp swing to the left up Elm Street.</p>

<p>At that time we were traveling very slowly, no more than 12 miles an hour.
In accordance with my custom, I was very much concerned about our timing
and at just about that point I looked at my watch and noted that it was almost
exactly 12:30 p.m., which was the time we were due at the Trade Mart. I commented
to Ken O'Donnell that it was 12:30 and we would only be about five
minutes late when we arrived at the Trade Mart. Shortly thereafter the first
shot went off and it sounded to me as if it were a firecracker. I noticed then
that the President moved quite far to his left after the shot from the extreme
right hand side where he had been sitting. There was a second shot and Governor
Connally disappeared from sight and then there was a third shot which
took off the top of the President's head and had the sickening sound of a grapefruit
splattering against the side of a wall. The total time between the first
and third shots was about 5 or 6 seconds. My first impression was that the
shots came from the right and overhead, but I also had a fleeting impression
that the noise appeared to come from the front in the area of the triple overpass.
This may have resulted from my feeling, when I looked forward toward the
overpass, that we might have ridden into an ambush.</p>

<p>At about the time of the third shot, the President's car accelerated sharply,
with the follow-up car driving right behind it. Mrs. Kennedy climbed onto
the back of the car. Perhaps she may have been looking for help and perhaps
she really didn't know what she was doing. I think Special Agent Clinton Hill
saved her life by climbing up on the back of the car and pushing her into the
back seat because she probably would have fallen off the rear end of the car
and would have been right in the path of the other cars proceeding in the
motorcade.</p>

<p>We proceeded at a high rate of speed to Parkland Hospital. Upon arriving at
the emergency entrance, I raced over to where President Kennedy lay and
Special Agent Hill and I, along with Special Agent Kellerman, placed him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
a stretcher. The three of us and Special Agent Greer pushed him into the
emergency area. I stayed with Mrs. Kennedy the entire time at the hospital.
She went in and out of the emergency room and when she wasn't in the emergency
room, she sat on a chair right outside the emergency room door. I believe Ken
O'Donnell went to call the Attorney General as soon as we arrived at the hospital.</p>

<p>I accompanied the President's body and Mrs. Kennedy on the trip from the
hospital to the airport. Some seats were removed from a rear compartment of
the President's plane and the casket was placed there. On the trip back to Washington,
Mrs. Kennedy refused to change her clothes or eat, but did sip some
coffee. Upon arriving at Andrews Air Force Base, Mrs. Kennedy declined to
take a helicopter to Bethesda Naval Hospital but instead chose to ride with
President Kennedy's body in the hearse. Kenneth O'Donnell and I stayed with
Mrs. Kennedy and the other members of the President's family at Bethesda until
the early hours of the morning on November 23, 1963.</p>

<h2 id="t474">AFFIDAVIT OF CLIFTON C. CARTER</h2>

<p>The following affidavit was executed by Clifton C. Carter on May 20, 1964.</p>

<p class="in0 right">
AFFIDAVIT</p>
<p class="in0">PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION<br />
ON THE ASSASSINATION OF<br />
PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">District of Columbia</span>, <i>ss</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>I, Clifton C. Carter, make the following affidavit concerning my knowledge of
the events of November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Vice President Johnson and I had been in Texas during the week preceding
November 22nd, and we had met the party of President Kennedy in San
Antonio, Texas, on Thursday, November 21, 1963.</p>

<p>I was on the Vice President's plane (AF-2) when it landed at Dallas Love
Field on November 22 at about 11:30 a.m. Vice President and Mrs. Johnson
left their plane and joined the reception party which greeted President and
Mrs. Kennedy, who arrived in the President's plane (AF-1). President and
Mrs. Kennedy then shook hands with people in the crowd along an iron fence.
While the Presidential party greeted the crowd, I went to the automobile where
I was to ride in the motorcade. It was a Secret Service vehicle assigned to
follow and protect the Vice President. Our car was right behind the Vice
President's automobile, which was immediately to the rear of the Presidential
Secret Service follow-up car, which drove right behind the President's automobile.</p>

<p>The automobile in which I rode was driven by a Dallas policeman. I sat in
the middle of the front seat and held some radio equipment on my lap. Special
Agent Jerry D. Kivett sat on my right and Special Agent Len Johns and someone
else were in the rear seat. This was an unmarked Dallas police car.</p>

<p>Nothing unusual occurred on the motorcade route from Love Field to the
downtown Dallas area. The crowds were very large and very friendly, except
for two or three signs which contained derogatory comments about President
Kennedy. I would estimate that the crowds were twice as big as they were in
September of 1960 when Mr. Kennedy campaigned in Dallas. The motorcade
slowed down at times, but I do not believe that it stopped.</p>

<p>The motorcade proceeded west on Main Street, made a right-hand turn onto
Houston and then swung around to the left on Elm, proceeding slowly at about
5 to 10 miles per hour. At approximately 12:30 p.m., our car had just made the
left-hand turn off Houston onto Elm Street and was right along side of the
Texas School Book Depository Building when I heard a noise which sounded
like a firecracker. Special Agent Youngblood, who was seated on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>right-hand
side of the front seat of Vice President Johnson's car immediately turned and
pushed Vice President Johnson down and in the same motion vaulted over the
seat and covered the Vice President with his body. At that instant Mrs. Johnson
and Senator Yarborough, who were riding in the back seat along with the
Vice President, bent forward. Special Agent Youngblood's action came immediately
after the first shot and before the succeeding shots.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember three shots. There was an interval of approximately
5 to 6 seconds from the first to the last shot, and the three shots were evenly
spaced. The motorcade promptly accelerated and traveled at high speeds up to
75 to 80 miles an hour to Parkland Memorial Hospital. The President's automobile,
the President's follow-up car, the Vice President's automobile, and the
Vice President's follow-up car pulled into the emergency entrance at Parkland.
Attendants from the hospital with two stretchers carried President Kennedy
and Governor Connally into the hospital. At one point I briefly helped
remove Governor Connally from the car onto the stretcher. After President
Kennedy and Governor Connally had been taken into the hospital, Vice President
Johnson, Mrs. Johnson, Special Agent Youngblood and I entered the emergency
area and were taken to a small room where we waited. I went out on a couple
of occasions to secure coffee. Congressmen Henry Gonzalez, Jack Brooks,
Homer Thornberry and Albert Thomas came into the room where Vice President
Johnson waited. About 1 o'clock Mrs. Johnson left the room, stating that she
wanted to visit with Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Connally.</p>

<p>At 1:12 p.m. Special Agent Emory Roberts brought the news that President
Kennedy was dead. At that moment the only people present were Vice President
Johnson, Congressman Thornberry, Special Agent Len Johns, and I. Special
Agent Roberts advised Vice President Johnson to return to the White House
forthwith because of the concern of the Secret Service that there might be a widespread
plot to assassinate Vice President Johnson as well as President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Vice President Johnson then asked that Kenny (O'Donnell) and Larry
(O'Brien) be consulted to determine what their views were on returning promptly
to Washington. Kenny and Larry came down and told Vice President Johnson
that they agreed he should return to Washington immediately. Vice President
Johnson then asked me to try to alert some of the members of his staff to go
to the airport for the return trip to Washington. I then proceeded to look for
those members of the staff, and I was later driven to Love Field by a young
Dallas policeman. By the time I returned to the Presidential plane (AF-1),
Vice President and Mrs. Johnson had already boarded the plane and arrangements
had already been made to have Vice President Johnson sworn-in as the
President. I do not have any personal knowledge of Vice President Johnson's
conversation with Attorney General Kennedy concerning the advisability of a
prompt swearing-in or of the arrangements to have Judge Sara Hughes participate
in that ceremony. I was present at the swearing-in and shortly thereafter
the President's plane took off for the Washington area.</p>

<p>The original conversations concerning President Kennedy's trip to Texas occurred
on June 5, 1963 at the Cortez Hotel in El Paso, Texas. President Kennedy
had spoken earlier that day at the Air Force Academy and Vice President Johnson
had spoken at Annapolis. The President and Vice President met with Governor
Connally at the Cortez Hotel to discuss a number of matters, including
a trip by the President to Texas. Fred Korth and I were present when the
three men assembled, but Fred Korth and I left during their discussion of the
President's proposed trip. The first tentative date was to have the trip coincide
with Vice-President Johnson's birthday on August 27th, but that was rejected
because it was too close to Labor Day. President Kennedy's other commitments
prevented him from coming to Texas any sooner than November 21st, which
was the date finally set.</p>

<h2 id="t476">TESTIMONY OF EARLE CABELL</h2>

<p>The testimony of Earle Cabell was taken at 9 a.m., on July 13, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission. Sam Kelley, assistant attorney general of Texas, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Hon. Earle Cabell, mayor of the city of
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Former mayor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I resigned in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Cabell, my name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the
advisory staff of the General Counsel of the President's Commission. Under the
provisions of Executive Order 11130 dated November 29, 1963, and the joint
resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the
President's Commission in conformance with that Executive order and the joint
resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, among
others.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relevant to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Cabell, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Cabell, you appeared today by virtue of a letter which I understand
was received by you on either July 8 or 9, written by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General
Counsel of the President's Commission; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you stand and raise your right hand? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give in this matter will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. My name is Earle Cabell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. My place of residence is 5338 Drane Drive, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Cabell, I understand that you were formerly the mayor of
Dallas, but you resigned about 2 or 3 months ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I was installed as mayor of Dallas May 1, 1961, for a 2-year term.
Was reinstalled May 1, 1963, upon reelection. Resigned that office on February 3,
1964, to become a candidate for the House of Representatives of the United
States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to your becoming mayor, what occupation did you have?
I simply want to get some background for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. For the past 30-odd years I have been engaged in dairy products
and food retailing in the city of Dallas and surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You still have that business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; I am not connected with that business officially any longer.
I retain my office at the former headquarters of that company, which is 4017
Commerce Street. I am on a retainer with the company in an advisory capacity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Cabell, we are interested in a number of matters, but I think
we can cover much of the ground by asking you to comment upon an interview
of you by FBI Agents Warren Debrueys and George Carlson on December 12,
1963, which I have marked for identification as follows: On the first page in the
right-hand margin I have marked "Dallas, Texas, July 13, 1964, Exhibit No. 1,
deposition of Honorable Earle Cabell." I have signed my name under that and
on each of these succeeding three pages I have marked my initials in the right-hand
lower corner.</p>

<p>Exhibit No. 1 consists therefore of 4 pages. Mr. Cabell, I think you have had
an opportunity to read this Exhibit No. 1; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I have read it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now I ask you if the exhibit, which is, as I have said, a report
of an interview of you by the FBI agents named, is an accurate and fair statement
of the conference or interview had between you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. It is entirely so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any corrections or additions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I find no corrections or additions to make to that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For the record, I would like you to state briefly just what was
the chain of command of governmental authority in the city of Dallas, starting
with you, I take it, as the top, on down at least to the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Under the charter of the city of Dallas, the city council is composed
of councilmen and the mayor, the mayor having the status of a councilman,
but also being the presiding officer elected by the people at large as the
mayor. He is the presiding officer and the spokesman for the council. The
council does not have administrative responsibilities nor authority. The council
is a legislative and policymaking body who appoint the city manager, among
certain other city officials or department heads.</p>

<p>The city manager in turn has the discretion of appointing those department
heads under his direct jurisdiction, including the appointment of the chief of
police. The council, by ordinance, is not authorized to, and in fact is prohibited
from taking direct administrative action through or over any of the
department heads appointed by and responsible to the city manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many members compose the council, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Eight members, in addition to the Mayor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are elected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. They are all elected by the citizens of Dallas at large. That
is, they are all voted upon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now the city manager, as I understand it, is appointed by the
council or by the mayor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; the city manager is appointed by the council, by council
action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now the city manager on November 22 through 24, 1963, was
Mr. Crull?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Elgin E. Crull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, for the record, you were then Mayor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think it might be well also for the record if we have the names
of the people that composed the council at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. The council at that time was composed of Mr. Carie Welch. He
was also mayor pro tem. Mr. William Roberts, Mrs. Tracy Rutherford, Mr. Joe
Moody, Mr. Joe Golman, Mrs. Elizabeth Blessing, Mr. George Underwood, Jr.,
Mr. R.&nbsp;B. Carpenter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that Mr. Crull had been serving as city manager
for quite some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Something over 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you describe briefly for us the relationship between the
mayor and the council and the city manager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Well, it is the relationship of the general manager of a corporate
entity and his board of directors, with most day-to-day contact being made
through the mayor as the presiding officer of that board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the city manager really has the detailed administration
of city affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. He is entirely responsible for the administrative functions of the
city government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the mayor, then, is responsible for policies with the council;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. As the presiding officer, the mayor has only one vote on the action
of the council, as any other councilman, but by virtue of being the presiding
officer and the spokesman of the council, then on day-to-day routine matters,
the contact of the city manager is through the mayor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does the council make any other appointments than the appointment
of the city manager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes; the direct appointees of the council are the city attorney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
the city secretary, the supervisor of public utilities, and the city auditor, with
the city auditor being nominated by the Dallas Clearing House Association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand then that the chief of police is appointed by the
city manager completely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is correct; and is responsible only to the city manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does the city council or mayor confirm the appointees of the
city manager? What authority do they have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. They confirm by virtue of approval of the budget wherein their
salaries are stipulated and they are named.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it is not an appointment such as with Federal officials
where the President appoints and the city confirms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now I want to ask you to state what you observed concerning
the actual shooting of the President, and perhaps the best way to start is to
tell us what position you were in in the Presidential parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. We were separated from the President's car by the car in which
the Vice President and Senator Yarborough were riding, and by a station wagon
holding, I think, certain members of the press and possibly some Secret Service,
and I believe one other car of Secret Service so there were either two or
three intervening cars between our place in the motorcade and the Presidential
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was in your car other than the driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Mrs. Cabell and Congressman Ray Roberts from McKinney, Tex.,
Congressman from the Fourth District, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just the three of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember who the driver was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I do not remember his name. He was a member of the Department
of Public Safety of the State of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you observe anything at all relative to the shooting
of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Well, we were just rounding the corner of Market and Elm, making
the left turn, when the first shot rang out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you describe what you saw or heard, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I heard the shot. Mrs. Cabell said, "Oh a gun" or "a shot", and
I was about to deny and say "Oh it must have been a firecracker" when the
second and the third shots rang out. There was a longer pause between the
first and second shots than there was between the second and third shots. They
were in rather rapid succession. There was no mistaking in my mind after
that, that they were shots from a high-powered rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you familiar with rifles so that your statement that it was
your opinion it came from a high-powered rifle was that of a person who knows
something about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I have done a great deal of hunting and also used military
shoulder guns, as well as hunting rifles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in the armed services during the war?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; I was not, but there was no question in my mind as to their
being from a high-powered rifle and coming from the direction of the building
known as the School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That you judged, I suppose, by the direction from which you
thought the sound came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you estimate the number of seconds, say, between the
first and second shots, as related to the number of seconds between the second
and third shots? Perhaps doing it on the basis of a ratio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Well, I would put it this way. That approximately 10 seconds,
elapsed between the first and second shots, with not more than 5 seconds having
elapsed until the third one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two to one ratio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Approximately that. And again I say that, as you mentioned,
as a matter of being relative. I couldn't tell you the exact seconds because they
were not counted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now when you became conscious that these were shots and that
they seemed to be coming from the building known as the Texas School Book
Depository Building, did you look toward that building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. My back was turned to it at the time, because I was riding in
the front seat and was conversing with Mrs. Cabell and Mr. Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were in the back? And you were next to the driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I was sitting in the front seat with the driver. This was a convertible
in which we were riding with the top down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that actually the shots seemed to you to come from behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. From behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you turn in the direction of the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I turned then, rather looking down toward the Presidential car,
and then I saw the people scattering and some throwing themselves on the
ground. One man threw himself over a child that was sitting in the grass
there. I did not observe anything in connection with the building itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not see anybody in any of the windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now I think you mentioned that Mrs. Cabell made a remark
to you, "Oh, that is a shot." I take it from what you have said, that remark
was made immediately after the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Just immediately; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And before the second and third, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. And really before I could get my answer out&mdash;I think it was
motivated by wishful thinking as much as anything else, to deny or to say
possibly it wasn't&mdash;then the second and third shots rang out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any other spontaneous remarks made by anyone
else in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Well, in the discussion which followed, both Mr. Roberts and
myself said that it must have been from a gun similar to a .30-06.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By spontaneous, I meant those remarks made just immediately,
not the discussion thereafter, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you do not recall any remarks made by anyone else of a
spontaneous nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what did you do after the shots were fired and the Presidential
car and the vice presidential car went on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Then we just followed and told the driver to follow them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went on then to <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. We went on to the hospital. We could not tell whether they
were just going back to the airport or going toward the hospital. Now there
was a question raised among us as to where we were headed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't in fact know who had been hit, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; we couldn't tell. We could tell, of course, there was confusion
in the presidential car&mdash;activity. The Secret Service men ran to that
car. From out of nowhere appeared one Secret Service man with a submachine
gun. His attention seemed to be focused up toward the building. One
of the motorcycle officers and the escort pulled his motorcycle over to the side
and jumped off with his drawn handgun and ran up the slope toward the
building, toward the School Book Depository. I do not recall any other shots
being fired than the three which I mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it also that you got to the hospital very shortly after
the Presidential car did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Of course, when we turned off of Stemmons Expressway, we
knew then that we were headed toward Parkland. Otherwise, we would have
proceeded on Stemmons to Mockingbird Lane, which would have been the
direct route to the airport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you got to the hospital, had the President been removed
from the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. He was in the process of being removed; was on the carriage.
Another carriage was brought out, and I was there and helped to steady the
carriage when the Governor was taken out of the car and placed on the carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
and wheeled in. And I helped escort the carriage on into the hospital
into the anteroom and stayed there until the body was removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you happen to go to the room in which a press conference
was held, at which the official announcement was made of the President's death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I was not in when any official thing&mdash;I assumed that the President
was dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I was trying to get the anteroom or hallway that you described.
Where was this with reference to the outside door of the hospital, or the emergency
room, or something of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Well, this was in the emergency section. There is a large anteroom
with a glassed-in enclosure where telephones were, and then off from that
larger room was a narrow anteroom from which a series of operating rooms
connected.</p>

<p>The President was in one of those, and directly across this little hallway then
was where Governor Connally was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any news people in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes; I am sure there must have been. I don't recall any whom
I recognized personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Specifically, do you know a reporter, newspaperman now with
Scripps-Howard, by the name of Seth Kantor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I can't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now there is some information, Mr. Cabell, that Jack Ruby was
around the hospital some place, either near the entrance or near the pressroom,
or something of that sort. And, of course, I take it that you now know what he
looks like, from pictures in the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Well, I knew him by sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew him by sight prior to this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had you known him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I would say for several years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him around the hospital then at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed until the President's body was removed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do after that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. We went&mdash;Mrs. Cabell accompanied me and went back to Love
Field. There was a number of members of the Texas delegation to the Congress
who had accompanied the President and Vice President on the trip down
here, and I more or less took them in tow and secured a station wagon from the
vehicles that were outside the hospital and carried them, at the direction of
one of the Secret Service agents who was more or less in charge in there, to
the Southwest Airmotive side of Love Field, which is the eastern side, because
he advised me that Air Force I would take off from that side. So there was
some with us in our car, and then the station wagon with the additional ones.
When we got to Southwest Airmotive, Air Force I was still parked on the west
side of the field where they had deplaned the passengers earlier. Realizing that
it was going to take off rather quickly, I asked the public relations man for
Southwest Airmotive to get on the radio and contact the Air Force officer in
charge through the control tower as to what to do about these men, whether to
bring them over to that side, or was the plane going to come over there.</p>

<p>We did not get a direct answer, but the squad car of the Dallas Police Department,
which is assigned to Love Field, came over and got us, apparently
through clearance of the control tower, and carried us right straight across the
field. Apparently they stopped any movement to get us across the field. Then
those men were able to board the plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, after you left the field, after Air Force I had left, what
was your activity then, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. We stayed there on the ground until after <i>Air Force 1</i> had taken
off with the body of the President. We conferred for a few minutes with
Sheriff Bill Decker and Chief of Police Curry. Chief Curry was in the plane
and a witness to the swearing in of President Johnson. Shortly after it took
off, then Mrs. Cabell, and I returned home. We dropped Mrs. Cabell off, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
then the driver carried me to Mr. Jonsson's house where I left my car, and then
I returned home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first know of the apprehension of Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. On the field there, Chief Curry told us of the killing of Officer
Tippit, and I believe told us at the same time that they had apprehended the
suspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, the suspect of the killing of the President, or of
Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That he was one and the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you what information he had to indicate that the
killer of Tippit was also the assassin of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Only that it was believed that he was one and the same. Now
the details, I did not get at that time either concerning the killing of Officer
Tippit or the subsequent apprehension of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your next contact with Curry, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I don't recall any further contact with Curry. This was not a
face to face or personal contact. It was telephonic concerning the issuance of
this parade permit, which is covered in the report by the bureau man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was a conference by telephone on Sunday the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had no contact, to your knowledge, with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I don't recall any further contact with Chief Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have a contact with any other member of the police
department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any knowledge of the situation in the county jail
with reference to the news media?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That was the city jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I beg your pardon, city jail, with reference to the covering of the
matter by the news media, and the confusion that came about as a result of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I knew fairly well what was going on by watching my own TV
from time to time and the covering that they had on the activities around the
police department of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any meeting of the council during the interval between
the 22d and the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any contact with City Manager Crull during that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. The Sunday morning, I knew that the city manager was out of
town, and in my conversation with Chief Curry subsequent to the shooting of
Oswald, I asked him if he had made contact with Mr. Crull, and suggested
that if he had not, that he do make immediate contact and ask for his return
to the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. This was after the shooting of Oswald. And he told me at that
time that Mr. Crull had been contacted and was on his way back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know prior to the shooting of Oswald, or have you
learned since whether there was any awareness in the police department of
possible danger to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No, no. After it had all occurred, then I recall having been told
by someone that there had been an attempt, or that an attempt would be made,
but that is not clear, and purely a matter of hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I believe in your conversation with Chief Curry on Sunday, you
discussed a threat that had been made to you, or indirectly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. He called me that this call had come through the switchboard of
the city hall, and it was his understanding that it was long distance, but he did
not know the source, and since it was a direct dial and they could not trace it,
there was not enough time, wherein the caller said that an attempt would be made
on my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you that was a long-distance call?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. It was his impression, the switchboard operator's impression that
it was some long distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was prior to Oswald's death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; that was following Oswald's death, and that is when he told
me that he was sending officers out to maintain security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Attached to page 3 it seems to indicate that the call with Curry
must have occurred a bit before you received the news of Oswald's shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. The first call from Curry, or only the starting of any conversations
with Chief Curry were relative to this torchlight parade on that night. I had
called him and told him that I would recommend the cancellation of that parade.
He had granted it, but then I had recommended the cancellation, and I would
assume full responsibility for having given that instruction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At that time Oswald had not been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But on that first call then, was there any discussion between you
and Chief Curry about the transfer of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any discussion about the security precautions that were
being observed or the problems that they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I do not recall any discussion on that at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief Curry did not tell you that any threats had been made to
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now during the period November 22 until the shooting of Oswald,
did you have any conversations with the press concerning the whole matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. There were a number of calls. There were members of the press,
both the national and international press that came to my home during that
period. I had given a statement on Friday night to both television stations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That was on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether any part of those statements or interviews
had to do with the transfer of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. None whatsoever. There was never any during that period.
There was never any mention of that. It was not brought up nor discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then later on Sunday morning, I understand after the security
call from Chief Curry, there was another call from him with regard to the death
of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. He called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean the shooting of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes; the incident referred to here about a friend calling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say "here." You are referring to page 3 of Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. "He received a telephone call from a friend." That friend was
Mrs. R.&nbsp;O. Alexander who said, "Do you have your television on?" And I said,
No. She said, "Get it on quick. They have just shot Oswald." And I immediately
turned my television on. I was in the den where I was sitting and
taking these telephone calls, and then just as I get it turned on, they still had
not removed Oswald at that time because this was just a matter of a minute or
2 from the actual shooting. Then Chief Curry called and said, "They have just
shot Oswald." And I said, "Yes; I have it on TV now."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was any action taken then by anybody, do you know, concerning,
first, security measures or further protection against?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Nothing to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think I have asked this before. If I have, then just disregard
it, but did you contact City Manager Crull during the interval?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; I did not contact him. Now he came to my home immediately
on his return to the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. This was, well, it was early afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. This was on the 24th, on Sunday; yes. It was about 1 o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you comment upon this Lancaster Smith Proposal of a
parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Lane Smith is a very well-known, very active lay worker in the
Catholic church, and he had called me earlier, and I think the suggestion for
this came from some nuns, and when he first talked to me I didn't realize frankly
the implications or the hazard of a procession such as that, and I told him&mdash;he
asked about a permit, and I said that that is a matter that is handled by the
chief of police, that he would have to be the one to issue a permit for any type
of parade, because that is what that amounted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the proposal of Mr. Smith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Well, a torchlight procession of both the clergy and any lay people
as a procession of mourning that would pass by the site of the assassination and
put flowers at the site.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was proposed for Sunday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That was proposed for Sunday night, and after having talked
with him, then the implications began to dawn on me, and when I realized
that that was in a rather poorly lighted area, it is not in the best part of town,
and that the procession itself would pass possibly under the very window of the
jail where Oswald presumably would be by that time, then that was the reason
behind my calling the chief then.</p>

<p>He told me he had issued the permit because he had no reason not to, and
then that is when I made the recommendation that it be canceled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was canceled in fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Oh, I think undoubtedly, because he said he would call Lanc
immediately back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did Lancaster Smith call you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I think it must have been around 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning,
originally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you called Chief Curry about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Must have been very shortly after that. I would say 9 o'clock
or possibly a short time after. I believe that it must have been just a little
before 10, because I think that he was talking to me in his office at the time
word was brought to him that Oswald was shot, or possibly had hung up the
phone, or he would have mentioned that to me at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because the evidence we now have shows that Oswald was shot
about 11:20, so perhaps your time would have been 11 rather than 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes; I was thinking in terms of 10 o'clock being the hour of
shooting, but we can move this conversation with Curry to a matter of minutes
preceding the shooting of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now were any threatening calls received by you directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Only one, which was received by Mrs. Cabell on New Year's Eve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. December 31, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. December 31, 1963; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any received indirectly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Only those that were reported to us by Chief Curry. There
was one incident which was not a call, but which was an unusual thing and
which caused a certain amount of apprehension.</p>

<p>On a Saturday evening, which one I can't tell you, but it was while security
was being maintained, that I decided to go out and eat dinner. Mrs. Cabell
did not want to go. She said she would just stay at home. One of the officers
stayed with Mrs. Cabell. The other one accompanied me to Tupinamba, a Mexican
cafe on Lovers Lane. I told Mrs. Cabell I would get Mexican food there.
There are three places in the immediate vicinity, all of which we patronize from
time to time.</p>

<p>The officer and I were in having our dinner when the proprietor came over and
said that I was wanted on the phone. I picked up the receiver. I could hear
traffic noises in the background, so I knew that the line was open. I said,
Hello several times, and the receiver clicked in my ear. I thought that
Mrs. Cabell had possibly tried to get hold of me, and I called her, and she
said, "No, she had not." So it was obvious that someone who was either in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
the restaurant and had left when we came in, or had seen us enter the restaurant,
put in this call, apparently just a nuisance or harassing type of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after you had been in the restaurant did this call
come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Oh, a matter of 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never found the source of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was any investigation made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. There was no way of making an investigation. The assumption
is that the call was placed from one of the public telephones that are up
and down that business section there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Cabell, there have been some reports as to the authenticity
or veracity of, for which I do not vouch at all, to the effect that some pressure
was put upon Chief of Police Curry by you or others to cooperate with the press
in all ways possible. I think in fairness I should give you an opportunity to
comment upon that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. There was one that has been rumored. One of our local weekly
publications made that as a statement. That is completely false. At no time
did I have any contact with Chief Curry to the extent that I gave him any
orders, instructions, or make any comment upon the situation other than the
contact which I have mentioned with reference to this proposed torchlight
parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any pressure put upon him by anyone in authority
over him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I do not know of any, and my assumption would be, and I say
assumption, would be that none had been made, because I know how Mr. Crull
operates to the extent that he would not interfere in the duties of his chief of
police. Now I am sure that they had conversations with reference to security
and that sort of thing, but I would question very definitely that any orders as
such on that subject would have been issued by Mr. Crull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, neither you nor anyone else, to your knowledge,
did anything of that sort, to wit, bring pressure upon him in anyway whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is entirely correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Cabell, do you have anything else to say, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No, sir; I don't know of anything else that I could add.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the commencement of the recordation of your testimony,
we had a very short conversation, but will you agree with me now that
there was nothing that was discussed in that conversation relating to the testimony
that has not been actually covered in the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is correct. I recall no conversation of any sort pertaining
to this incident that has not been covered in the examination under this
deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir, thank you very much.</p>

<p>(The following questions were asked upon completion of the deposition of
Mrs. Earle Cabell.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mayor Cabell, I wonder if you would agree for just a couple of
questions for your deposition to be continued under the same terms and conditions
that I began, and that you are under the same oath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like for you to comment, if you will, please, about the
recordation of conversations on your telephone, telling us when the recordation
system was set up, and when removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. It was set up on Sunday afternoon. That would have been the
24th; which recorded all conversations that came into action when the receiver
was taken off the hook. It was removed on, I would say, after about 3 weeks.
I am quite sure that it had been removed prior to December 31.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you yourself ever learned of any conversations that were
of a threatening nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have not heard the tape, of course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is reasonable to suppose that if any had been recorded, it
would have been brought to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I am sure it would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who has the possession of that tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. The police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They still have it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I am assuming that they still have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, thank you very much, sir. I certainly thank both of
you.</p>

<h2 id="t485">TESTIMONY OF MRS. EARLE CABELL</h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Earle Cabell was taken at 10 a.m., on July 13, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission. Sam Kelley, assistant attorney general of Texas, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mrs. Earle Cabell. Mrs. Cabell, my
name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff of the general
counsel of the President's Commission. Under the provisions of Executive
Order 11130 dated November 29, 1963, and the joint resolution of Congress No.
137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the President's Commission in conformance
with that Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized
to take a sworn deposition from you, among others.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relevant to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In
particular as to you, Mrs. Cabell, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts
you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Cabell, you appear today by virtue of a letter addressed actually
to you and your husband, Mayor Earle Cabell, by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, general
counsel of the staff of the President's Commission, is that correct? That letter
was dated either the 8th or 9th, or in any case was received on the 8th or 9th
of July?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now will you stand, please, and take the oath? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give in this matter will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Please state your name for the record, please, ma'am.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Mrs. Earle Cabell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are the wife of former Mayor Earle Cabell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You reside with him now at what address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. 5338 Drane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Cabell, I think you were with your husband in the presidential
parade on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wish you would tell us in your own words what you observed
concerning the shooting of the President. I might say that your husband has
testified that you were in the second or third car behind the President's car&mdash;the
third or fourth car.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Third or fourth. We have never been able to be sure about
that, because we were under the impression&mdash;of course, the chief of police's car
preceded the presidential car, and we were under the impression that it was the
presidential car, the vice presidential car, the station wagon apparently with
Secret Service men, and then our car. There have been other statements made
which we have never been quite sure of, that there was a Secret Service car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
between the presidential car and the vice presidential car. If that is true, we
were one car further back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were sitting on the rear seat of the convertible?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Behind the driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Behind the driver. That would have <span class="locked">put&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Me on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was on your right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Congressman Ray Roberts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your husband was seated to the left of the driver on the front
seat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. The right of the driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The right of the driver. Now will you tell us in your own words,
ma'am, what you saw and heard concerning the President's death?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. As my husband has told you, he had his back to the School
Depository Building. He was looking back talking to us.</p>

<p>Congressman Roberts was sitting just as this lady is now, and turned the
same way. I was turned facing him. We were looking directly at each other.
The position of our car was such that when that first shot rang out, my position
was such that I did not have to turn to look at the building. I was directly
facing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your car was still really on Houston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; we were making the turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just on the turn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Just on the turn, which put us at the top of the hill, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Since you were actually turned toward Representative Roberts
on your right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Actually, you were <span class="locked">facing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. The building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Texas Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I was actually facing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the first thing you noticed of an extraordinary nature,
or heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I heard the shot, and without having to turn my head, I jerked
my head up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why did you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Because I heard the direction from which the shot came, and I
just jerked my head up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I saw a projection out of one of those windows. Those windows
on the sixth floor are in groups of twos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In which window did you see the projection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I have always been a little confused about that, but I think it
was the first window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. On the top floor. Now I cannot take oath and say which window.
There was some confusion in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you say there were double windows. Is the confusion
about whether it was the first or second double window, or the first or second
window of the double windows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. The first or second window of the first group of double windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was this projection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I cannot tell you. It was rather long looking, the projection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did it seem like? An arm of an individual, or something
mechanical?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I did not know, because I did not see a hand or a head or a
human form behind it. It was in just a fleeting second that I jerked my head
up and I saw something in that window, and I turned around to say to Earle,
Earle, it is a shot, and before I got the words out, just as I got the words out,
he said, "Oh, no; it must have been a&mdash;&mdash;" the second two shots rang out.
After that, there is a certain amount of confusion in my mind. I was acutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
aware of the odor of gunpowder. I was aware that the motorcade stopped
dead still. There was no question about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you, after the first shot and your observation of this
object in that window as you have described it, you turned your attention from
that window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you were not looking in the direction of that window
when the second and third shots were fired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you look in that direction thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. If I did, I don't recall. I am completely aware of the people
running up that hill. I saw the man throw the child on the ground and throw
himself. I saw a woman in a bright green dress throw herself on the ground.
I saw the policeman running up the grassy slope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You also mentioned that you were acutely aware of the smell of
gunpowder?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that relative to the shots? I mean how soon after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I cannot say for sure, because as I told you, the motorcade was
stopped. And somewhere in there, Congressman Roberts said, "That is a
.30-06." I didn't know what a .30-06 was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say that after all the shots were fired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I believe so. There was much confusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was about that time that you observed the odor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was when your car at least had come to a standstill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Every car in the motorcade had come to a standstill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, of course, it was before you followed on to the
hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make the observation to anyone at that time that you
had smelled gunpowder?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; because there was too much confusion. But I mentioned
it to Congressman Roberts when we were in Washington a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say that he had observed it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. As well as I remember, he said "Yes." We were in a group,
a large group, and there was much conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear any other spontaneous remarks by anyone else?
By spontaneous remarks, I mean remarks made then, not later.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Congressman Roberts&mdash;and I believe this was after the third
shot, because we were dead still for a matter of some seconds&mdash;then when the
motorcade started up, Congressman Roberts said&mdash;these might not be his exact
words, but this is what he meant: "If all is well ahead, we are headed for
Love Field. We are getting out."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. His previous remark about the caliber of the rifle, which you did
not at that time understand, was made after the third shot was fired and before
you began to move?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any other remark made by anyone other than those
that you have covered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; except that as the motorcade started up, he said, "If all is
<span class="locked">well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Congressman Roberts said, "If all is well, we are headed for
Love Field. We are getting out."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the driver say anything, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I don't recall that he said a word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During the time that you were standing absolutely still for a
few seconds, did you have occasion, or did you in fact look up at that window
again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Not again, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to the hospital too?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. When we reached the hospital, the Presidential car was pulled
up toward the slot ordinarily reserved for ambulances, which pulled us up a
little closer to the entrance of the hospital. And as my husband jumped out of
the car, he turned around and looked at me and said, "Stay in the car." And
I believe at that time that Congressman Roberts got out of the car. The Texas
delegation was standing around the cars at that time. And I sat in the car
with our driver for quite some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long, about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I cannot tell you. Time left me that day. I sat there for quite
a long time. I stood up and I saw them taking the President out of the car.
I saw my husband by the carriage when the Governor was taken out of the
car. Then our driver, after they went into the hospital, turned the car radio
on and we and the other members of the Texas delegation, Senator Yarborough,
all of the others&mdash;the delegation moved back and forth from the car where I
was sitting, up to the door of the hospital. It is my impression that none of
them went in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes; twice. Do you want me to tell you both times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Well, this is a little difficult for me to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it this way. What I am interested in is whether
or not you saw Jack Ruby there. Did you know him prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course you have seen his pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Since; but I had never seen him before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him at any place that you went in the hospital, in
front of the hospital, or about the hospital on that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In order to know where you were, to exclude your seeing him
there, would you tell us just what places you were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. In the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you out there for some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. There came a time when it was necessary for me to find a ladies'
room. I walked up to one of the many police officers at the door and I said,
Officer, I am Mrs. Earle Cabell. He said, "Yes, Mrs. Cabell, I know." I have
no idea which officer it was. I said, "It is necessary for me to go into the ladies'
room. Can you get me in?" He said, "I can try." He had quite a good deal
of trouble getting me in and identifying me. They did not let me go in until
a nurse's aid was brought to the door. They did not let me stay on the first
floor where the emergency section was. They took me to the left. This nurse's
aid took me to the left with the police officer following, and we crossed the cafeteria
and went over toward the front of the building. The nurse's aid went
into the ladies' room with me. The policeman stood at the door. We went
back the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell me who was guarding the front door so that there was
some difficulty getting you in.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I do not know. An elderly man in shirt sleeves, that I remember.
I assume he was a part of the hospital personnel. I don't really know that
to be true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there police or State police or city police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. They were everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you mean they were checking people going into the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes. Then as I came in, the policeman escorted me back to
our car. I sat there again, I do not know how much longer I sat, but somebody
brought me a Coca-Cola. We, as you know, had nothing to eat or drink
since coffee at Mr. and Mrs. Eric Jonsson's, where we gathered before going
to Love Field. Then a man came up to me. I have to assume that he was
a Secret Service man. He said, "Are you Mrs. Earle Cabell?" I said, "Yes."
He said, "There are no ladies presently with Mrs. Kennedy. We feel that it
might be nice if you go in." So I handed my partially drunk Coca-Cola to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
driver, and I went in with this man. Another thing that makes me think he
had some authority was that this second time when we got to the door, this
man said, "This is Mrs. Earle Cabell," and we walked right in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He said that to whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. The man at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The same man that had been at the door before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I assume it was. There was such a short time that elapsed.
He took me down. You turn to the right as you went in the door down this
very wide hall, and as we were going down the hall, we met my husband
coming toward us going out. I looked at him and he said, "I will be back."
So we walked on in to this smaller hallway which separated the emergency
rooms, either side of them. Mrs. Kennedy was sitting just outside the door of
Emergency Room No. 1 in a straight chair. I walked up to <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. She was alone. There were, I am sure, Secret Service men.
There was a group of men standing behind her, but she was sitting alone. I
walked up to her and I said, "Mrs. Kennedy, I am Elizabeth Cabell. I wish
there was something that I could do to help." And in a very dazed manner
she said, "Yes, I remember you gave me the roses." And somebody put a chair
by her for me and we sat there for just a few moments. And she said, "I would
like a cigarette." My purse was on the floor behind my chair. I turned
around to pick up my purse to give her a cigarette, and when I turned back
around, she was walking into Emergency Room No. 2. I judge that it was next
to the President, the room the President's body was in, and her purse was on a
carriage in that emergency room. She was fumbling in her purse, and I said to
her, "I have a cigarette here for you." It was exactly as though she had not
heard me. She didn't answer me at all, and she kept fumbling in her purse
and finally she came up with a cigarette. Then she turned to me as though
she had never seen me before, but said, "But I don't have a match." And I
said, "I have a match here for you." I lighted her cigarette and she turned
around and walked out of that emergency room. We went back to the two
chairs outside of Emergency Room No. 1 and sat down.</p>

<p>Just at that time I looked up and saw a Catholic priest coming toward us.
It was not Father Huber. It was a man I did not recognize. I later understood
he was the Catholic chaplain of the hospital. I am not sure about
that. I got up and walked a few steps to meet him, and I said, "Father,
take my chair by Mrs. Kennedy." Which he did do. In the meantime, my
husband had come back in, and I stepped back where my husband was standing,
and we stood there until the casket was wheeled out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was any announcement made to Mrs. Kennedy of the death of
her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Not while I was in there. I am under the impression&mdash;you see,
I was still sitting out in the car when they brought Vice President, I guess then,
and Mrs. Johnson out and put them in the car and took them away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know of the President's death when you went to Mrs.
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Congressman Roberts had come back to the car and said, "He is
gone."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is your impression that Mrs. Kennedy then knew of the
death of her husband when you first came up to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. That is my impression. We did not discuss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now I understand that there was a telephone call received by you
that was of a threatening nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us about that, please, ma'am? The time and so
forth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes; it was New Year's Eve. Of necessity, the security had
asked us not to be out, that so many people had come in for the New Year's
Day game, that they were uneasy. There was the possibility that Chief Justice
Warren might come. There was the rumor that he might come. There was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
rumor that the President himself might come. We knew that the President's
daughters were here, so they asked us not to wander around that night. We
have spent New Year's night for many years with a very close group of friends,
so we invited them to our home that night, but we explained to them that early
in the evening and under rather heavy security, we went downtown to the
Sheraton Hotel into a private suite to greet the Under Secretary of Navy and
his wife. We stayed in this group possibly 30 or 40 minutes and then we went
back to our home. At that time security had been lessened in our home. There
were only two men with us at all times then. It had been much heavier earlier.
The men had been in our home so long that they were like members of the family
almost. They knew most of our guests because they had accompanied us on the
Christmas parties and festivities that we went to. We were never without them.</p>

<p>We did not drive our own cars for 2 months. So most of these guests were
known to the security officers that were in our home that night. But I am again
hazy on the time. It must have been about 11 o'clock. I walked back into our
bedroom for something, and the phone rang back there. I picked it up. This
man's voice&mdash;it was not a kid, it was not a drunk&mdash;said, "Mrs. Cabell?" I said,
Yes. He said, "We are coming to kill that God damn mayor now." And hung
up the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell me, do you have a listed number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. An unlisted number. That is what startled us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is an unlisted number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes; it is an unlisted number, and that is what startled us. I
walked out of the bedroom through the living room, through the dining room,
and into the kitchen and caught the eye of one of the security officers and motioned
to him. He followed me back into the bedroom, and I closed the door and
told him what had happened. He walked straight to the phone and called his
superior officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you, did this seem to be a local call, or long distance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I have no way of knowing. When I picked up the phone and
said "Hello," this man's voice said, "Mrs. Cabell."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he said what you have just said, and that is all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. He hung up before I did. So Officer Beaty picked up the phone
and called his superior. I had said to him, "Please ask what to do about our
guests." Because there had always been the thinking among the security officers,
the possibility of a bomb being thrown at the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you, was your unlisted phone number carefully
guarded or kept?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No, no. It was given to our church. It was given to the press.
They all had it. They had to talk to Earle. It was given to some organizations
to which we belonged. The thinking on our part was that we wanted to be
available to responsible people. It was merely the crank calls that we were
trying to avoid after Earle went in office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So it was rather widely disseminated, and I suppose recorded
by those people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Who it had been given to; that's right. So it was not an impossible
number to obtain. It couldn't be in Earle's position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Storey</span>. (after shortly entering the room). Mr. Hubert, I might say I
had trouble in finding it the one time I wanted to call the mayor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, Mrs. Cabell, I have nothing more to ask you. If you
have anything you would like to say concerning the subjects we have covered,
or anything else pertinent to the inquiry, we would be glad to hear from you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I do not know of anything that would be of any help except that
from Earle's experience at Tupinamba, that somebody knew when those police
cars pulled in and out of that driveway. There was always one facing the
street. They were not squad cars. They were cars that the Special Service
men drove. They were Galaxies, different color, but they all carried the license
that people who knew about things like that could recognize them as being a
police car. One evening Chief Curry called and talked to my husband and said
things had been so quiet that if you and Mrs. Cabell feel all right about it, I
am going to bring the boys in. And my husband said, "Now Chief, that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
always been up to you. Whatever you think, is what we want you to do. Within
30 minutes, I would say, after the security officers and the cars had gone, a
threatening call came through the police switchboard, so within another 30
minutes the security was back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; I cannot give you the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come to know of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I didn't know it until the next morning. The boys didn't come
in the house that night. Earle didn't know it. We have a very trusted colored
man who has been with us 26 years, and when he used his own key to come in
the house next morning, I said, "Well, Phillip, I guess you miss our friends."
And he said, "Mrs. Cabell, they haven't gone. They are outside." And I
looked out the kitchen window and there they were. I went <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't know, do you, whether that threatening call made
reference to the fact that the security had been removed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; I do not. But the thinking on the part of the police was
that somebody was watching that driveway, because the call came in within 30
minutes after the car had gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else that you wish to say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Only that, and days again escape me&mdash;I think it was the day of
the President's funeral, my husband was in Washington. This can be verified,
because by that time all of our phone calls were recorded. The phone rang
early one afternoon, and I picked it up, and this man's voice said, "Mrs. Cabell."
I said "Yes." He said, "This is so-and-so&mdash;and the name I did not catch, or
recall&mdash;said "I am with one of the news media. I would like to come out for
an interview." Or words to that effect. And I said, "Well, Mr. Cabell is not
here. You will have to talk to him about that." Then he said to me, "How
heavily are you being guarded out there? Do you still have security?" And
I don't know what I said, but I put it off. I passed it off. And by that time
I had motioned to the security man that was in the next room, and he picked
up the receiver, but the man had hung up by that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mentioned that your calls were being recorded as early as
the date of the President's funeral?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No; earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Earlier?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Because the telephone men were out there within an hour after
the shooting of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They set up a recordation system whereby all calls could be
recorded?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that still on at the time of New Year's Eve?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that removed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I can't tell you. Sometime during that 2 months, but I cannot
say when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do not think it was on at the time of the New Year's
Eve call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. I am sure it wasn't, because the little recording machine, or
whatever it was, had <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Soundscriber?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Had been removed, and I believe I am correct in saying that
that was removed at the time, and I can't give you a date, that they cut down to
only two officers at a time being with us. For a long time there were two with
me and two with Earle and two at the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Cabell, I don't think there was actually any conversation
much before the recordation of your deposition began between us, but in any
case, I think you will agree with me that nothing was covered during the unrecorded
conversation we had that has not been recorded here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. As far as I know; that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much, ma'am.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cabell</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t492">TESTIMONY OF PHILLIP L. WILLIS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Phillip L. Willis was taken at 2:30 p.m., on July 22, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you raise your right hand [standing]? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Please sit down. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am an
attorney on the staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy. I have been authorized to take your testimony by
the Commission pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order No.
11130, dated November 29, 1963, and joint resolution of Congress No. 137.
Under the rules of the Commission's procedure, you are entitled to have an
attorney present if you wish to have him here. You are entitled to 3 days'
notice for the hearing, and you are entitled to exercise whatever privileges
there are available to you as far as not answering questions are concerned. I
assume that you are prepared to go ahead with your testimony without an
attorney present, because you are here without one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Phillip L. Willis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. 2824 Ava Lane, Dallas 27, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. August 2, 1918.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Kaufman County, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you lived in Texas throughout most of your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. All my life, with the exception of my military service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you lived here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Since April 1, 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What business are you engaged in, or by whom are you
employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I am a retired major, Air Force, disabled World War II, and
I am on disability retirement from the Air Force. I am an independent real
estate broker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is my understanding that you were in the vicinity of the
Texas School Book Depository Building on November 22, 1963, at the time of
the assassination; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me where you were and what you saw happen, and
what you did at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I had a driver drop my family and I in the parkway so that we
could have a chance to get a good view of the President's party, having taken
my children out of school for the occasion. We were told by the policeman
that they were coming down from Main Street approaching the area on Main,
and I stood at the corner of Main and Houston and watched them approach.
I am an amateur photographer, a poor one, but we wanted to get some good
colored pictures of the President. So I photographed the President coming in
front of the courthouse and making the turn onto Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you station yourself at first? Were you at the
corner, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. At the corner of Houston and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that you saw <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Across from the county jail on the parkway there near the
esplanade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you saw the motorcade coming down Main Street, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes; we could see it for a block or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then the motorcade turned onto Houston and you took some
pictures at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I remained there until I got the shot of the President approaching
the turn onto Houston Street, and being a personal friend of then Vice
President Lyndon Johnson, we were anxious to get him in one, and did. Then
I took a picture as they turned onto Houston Street. Then another one from
the rear after they proceeded down Houston approaching the turn they were to
make onto Elm. Then I immediately ran across the plaza, raced over to Elm
Street and stationed myself on the curb in front of the Texas School Book
Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were there when the motorcade made a left turn on Houston
and went down Elm Street; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes; and I photographed the President. I was standing in front
of the curb, as is shown in Life magazine, on the edge of the street, and I
photographed the presidential car at not more than 10 feet because I didn't
get the front or the rear of the car. I just got the occupants in the center. I
was that close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you have indicated that you are depicted in a picture
which is in the John F. Kennedy Memorial Edition of Life magazine in a picture
that you said you were in the upper left-hand corner of page 4; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are the individual who stands almost directly behind the
first motorcycle policeman in that picture, and you are shown with a camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. With my camera raised; yes, sir. The little girl in the red dress
and white scarf and coat is my daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The farthest person in the right in the back of that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The farthest person in that picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now did you stand at that particular spot the entire time, or
did you move down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir; I took that picture just seconds before the first shot was
fired, to get back close up. Then I started down the street, and the regular
weekly edition of Life magazine came out and shows me in about three different
pictures going down the street. Then my next shot was taken at the very&mdash;in
fact, the shot caused me to squeeze the camera shutter, and I got a picture of the
President as he was hit with the first shot. So instantaneous, in fact, that the
crowd hadn't had time to react.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you have, as I understand it, a series of 12 slides, which
apparently have been prepared by something called Phil Willis Enterprises, and
which I understand is being marketed, at least in the Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. We haven't done anything with them as yet, but I am the only
one, I am told, who has a complete set of the prints covering the last 25 seconds
of the President's life and the assassination and the tragedy following.</p>

<p>I was so shocked I didn't sell any, like everyone did at the moment. And the
same people who bought those said they would have been invaluable had I
brought them to them, but it didn't dawn on me to do that. And later there has
been so many requests because of the historical nature, that we felt compelled to
make them available to the public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have here a picture that has been marked Hudson Exhibit
No. 1, which I now show you and I suggest to you that it is one of the pictures
that is a picture made from one of the slides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I made that picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You made that picture yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is the same as slide No. 5? In your series of slides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us when that picture was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. That picture was made at the very instant that the first shot was
fired. As a matter of fact, the fellow standing on the ledge under the right-hand
corner of the Stemmons Highway sign is a gentleman who took the last pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
that appeared in Life, and his pictures showed that this instant with this sign
in between the photographer and the President, shows that at this instant he had
already grabbed his throat.</p>

<p>This was pointed out to the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Picture No. 2 will verify that, in Life magazine. You see the highway
sign that he has the rear of, is the one I have the front of. And as he approached
this same sign in this film, he has already grabbed his throat. That is verified
by that fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Referring to the pictures on page 4 of the memorial edition of
Life magazine. Picture No. 1 shows you standing, as we have already indicated,
standing back with your camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Picture 2 shows the President just as the car comes from behind
this sign, and it shows that he has already reached for his throat at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The sign in question is one that reads "Stemmons Freeway
Keep Right", and the front of that sign appears in the picture that you took
which is marked Hudson Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The only one in that vicinity. It has to be the same one. You
will also note in my first picture, he is facing the outside of the street and
smiling and waving, and he had already turned his head the other way when I
have the picture in question here from the rear.</p>

<p>That same picture from the other side of the street in Life shows he has
grabbed his throat when they proceeded to that point of the sign in question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go through that again. I didn't understand it. Let me remind
you of this. When you mention a picture, let's try and refer to them by numbers,
because if you do that, I won't have to repeat it again, because we have to get
the numbers down on the record. You were making a point just a minute ago
about something that I didn't understand. You were referring to some of the
pictures in Life magazine, and also to Hudson Exhibit No. 1, which is the picture
you took.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. All right, sir, Hudson Exhibit No. 1, which is a copy of the picture
I took, shows the President's car had proceeded almost past the "Stemmons
Freeway Keep Right" sign. Referring back to panel No. 2 of the Life Memorial
Edition of Life magazine on page 4, it shows that Mrs. Kennedy has her hand
over her mouth, and the President has already grabbed his throat. That picture
shows that his car has not passed the Stemmons sign completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Referring back to Hudson Exhibit No. 1, which I took, the President's
car in fact has passed the Stemmons sign, and he has turned the opposite
direction from the previous picture that I took close up, and it proves without
question that at this instant the President had been hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you mentioned the picture that you took, the other picture
that you took close up. Is that included in your set of slides here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir; it is slide No. 4, which you see doesn't include the front
or the rear of the President's car, but the center. That is proving how close
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Picture No. 4 in your group of slides was taken shortly before
picture No. 5 was taken, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir; not more than 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know which picture you were taking or you took at
the time that is shown here in panel No. 1 of this memorial edition of Life
magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir; the number just mentioned, slide No. 4, the closeup
of the President directly in front of the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now from the time that you took No. 4, and when you took No. 4,
you were standing as shown in picture No. 1 in Life magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do before you took No. 5, which we have marked
here as Hudson Exhibit No. 1? Did you move down the street, or were you
standing in the same place, or do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir; as human nature would guide in an instance of this importance,
I moved down the street slightly to try to get another view, and, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
course, I had the camera looking through the viewfinder to try to get another
picture of him before he went out of range. I moved as far as I could within
that 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you are not able to tell us exactly where you were when you
took the picture that we have here as Hudson Exhibit No. 1, but it was a little
bit farther on down Elm Street, still on the grassy area described by Elm and
Main Street; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir; I can verify that where I was going back to Life
magazine again, because this picture No. 2 on page 4 of the John F. Kennedy
Memorial Edition of Life, there is a tree in the background. The only tree in
that immediate vicinity on that side of the street. And the shadow of that tree
is shown in slide No. 5 that I took, which would show my position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes. I see you would have to study just from where the sun
was coming, but it could be determined where you were standing, and we could
also apparently determine it by lining it up with across the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Off the record. Let me say this. You see in No. 1 shot where I
am shown, you can see this shadow on the ground from this tree. This little
bush&mdash;there is the shadow from the tree. This tree is on the ground, so if
you look in my picture here, you can see the shadow in that picture. So you
see that I did move down approximately this far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All right. Now, you are certain that the first shot was fired
at approximately the time or shortly at approximately the time you took the
picture that has been marked Hudson Exhibit No. 1; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I am positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember hearing the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Absolutely. I, having been in World War II, and being a deer
hunter hobbyist, I would recognize a high-powered rifle immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you recognize this as a high-powered rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you heard it just about the time you took the picture that
has been marked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Prior to the time you took the picture, which is marked Hudson
Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many shots were fired altogether, Mr. Willis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any question about that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you follow the car down Elm Street after you took the
picture, which we have marked Hudson Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I proceeded down the street and didn't take any other pictures
instantly, because the three shots were fired approximately about 2 seconds
apart, and I knew my little daughters were running along beside the Presidential
car, and I was immediately concerned about them, and I was screaming
for them to come back, and they didn't hear me. But I was concerned about
them immediately, because I knew something tragic had happened, and the shots
didn't ring out long like a rifle shot that is fired into midair in a distance. I
knew it hit something, and it couldn't have been a firecracker or anything like
that, so it impressed me, I remember, and after I found my daughters, I saw
they were heading back toward their mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. She was back in the crowd looking through this concrete structure.
How do you refer to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, your wife was back closer toward the intersection of Main
Street and Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No; it is a very short distance when you stand in here. No;
that is the one across the street&mdash;no; here she was. She was in between Main,
and Elm Streets, but real near Elm Street. In fact, she was only a few feet back
from my daughters. She wasn't more than 40 feet from where the President
was hit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So she was toward the triple underpass from the concrete structure
on Dealey Plaza?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. She was inside the concrete structure looking through an opening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Looking toward the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Toward the Texas School Book Depository where she had a clear
view, and there were surprisingly few people there at that time&mdash;at that
moment&mdash;and none in between her and the street to block her vision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you actually observe the President when he was hit in the
head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir; I did not. I couldn't see that well, and I was more concerned
about the shots coming from that building. The minute the third shot
was fired, I screamed, hoping the policeman would hear me, to ring that building
because it had to come from there. Being directly across the street from the
building, made it much more clear to those standing there than the people who
were on the side of the street where the building was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you thought you had picked out a particular building at the
time when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What building was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were pretty sure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I felt certain. I even looked for smoke, and I knew it came from
high up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I even observed the clock on top of the building, it was 12:33 when
I looked up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The clock on top of the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. There is a Hertz sign on top of the building, and it alternates
the time of day and the temperature, and when I looked up, it was 12:33, and
the temperature was 68 degrees, as shown in my slide on No. 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you did not actually observe the President at the time he
was hit in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir; I was just taking a picture of him, and the presidential
party in the car come through my viewfinder and my camera. But my little
daughter ran back and said, "Oh, Daddy, they have shot our President. His
whole head blew up, and it looked like a red halo."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which one? Is this the girl that is here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The little one was the one that made that remark. My youngest
daughter, Rosemary. The one that is with me today also saw it, and she went
back and told her mother the same thing. And her mother said, "Yes; I saw
it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you see anything hitting in the street along the President's
car as it went down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say there were three shots fired? You heard three shots
fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that the President had been hit by the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I didn't really know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You couldn't tell whether he was hit by the first shot? You
couldn't tell whether he had been hit by the first shot or the second shot or
the third shot, or by how many shots he had been hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir; except this one thing might be worthy of mention. When
I took slide No. 4, the President was smiling and waving and looking straight
ahead, and Mrs. Kennedy was likewise smiling and facing more to my side of
the street. When the first shot was fired, her head seemed to just snap in that
direction, and he more or less faced the other side of the street and leaned
forward, which caused me to wonder, although I could not see anything positively.
It did cause me to wonder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that the President looked toward his left; is that
correct? Toward the side of Elm Street that you are standing on, or which way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. In slide No. 4 he was looking pretty much toward&mdash;straight
ahead, and she was looking more to the left, which would be my side of the
street. Then when the first shot was fired, she turned to the right toward him
and he more or less slumped forward, and it caused me to wonder if he were
hit, although I couldn't say.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In order to clarify some of the discussion we have had about
the various number of slides, I want to mark a set of your slides as Willis Exhibit
No. 1 and I have initialed a set of these, Mr. Willis, with my own initials,
and I will ask you to do the same thing for the purpose of identification so we
know what we are talking about when we refer to this exhibit.</p>

<p>(Mr. Willis marks initials.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have already established that the picture that has been
marked as Hudson's Exhibit No. 1 is a print made from the negative or from
slide No. 5 on Willis' Exhibit No. 1; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have occasion to look up toward the railroad tracks
that go across the triple underpass at any time, at about the time the President
was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes; I did, after the third shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anybody up there? Did you see anybody up there
on those railroad tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir; I had noticed before the President's arrival that there
were spectators up there, but there were also policemen up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did see policemen up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir; there were definitely policemen up there among the
spectators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About how many spectators would you say were up there? Was
there a big crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir; there was no big crowd in the area, actually. But I
would say, and this is strictly a wild guess, maybe 2 dozen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see any evidence of any shots having been fired from
that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No, sir; there was no doubt in my mind. I saw people falling
on the ground and police officers racing over toward a concrete wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Across the street from Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Across the street from Elm Street on the same side as the School
Book Depository, which goes down the hill toward the underpass, and the policemen
started going over there, called to see if someone, evidently thinking it came
from that direction, and then is when I started to ring this building. I knew it
came from high above directly across the street from me, and that is the one thing
I was absolutely positive about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You made that judgment from the sound of the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. From the sound, absolutely. And this may be verified by the fact
that I took several pictures of the crowd immediately around that building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; I notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I had no doubt about that, because I was that certain in my own
mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think I have any other questions about these pictures,
unless you can think of something else that you think I should have asked you
about, that I have forgotten about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. In slide No. 6, people were still on the ground and I took that
picture, knowing that the party had come to a temporary halt before proceeding
on to the underpass, and I have an arrow there which shows the back of the
Secret Service agent climbing onto the back of the presidential car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is that far in the background, way in the back of the
picture, or down toward the underpass of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes; that would be the background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think I would like to ask your daughter about three or four
questions about what she saw of it. We might just bring her in while you are
still here.</p>

<h2 id="t498">TESTIMONY OF LINDA KAY WILLIS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Linda Kay Willis was taken at 3:15 p.m., on July 22, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you rise and raise your right hand and I will swear you
as a witness. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As I told your father, I am an attorney for the President's Commission
on the Assassination of President Kennedy, and he has told me that you
were with him in the vicinity of the School Book Depository Building at the time
of the assassination, and I wanted to ask you two or three questions about that.</p>

<p>First of all, would you state your name for the reporter, please?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Linda Kay Willis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I will be 15, July 29.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your father has told us that you were out in front of the School
Book Depository Building along with your sister on the day of the assassination,
and your mother and father were also there, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear any shots, or what you later learned to be shots,
as the motorcade came past you there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes; I heard one. Then there was a little bit of time, and then
there were two real fast bullets together. When the first one hit, well, the
President turned from waving to the people, and he grabbed his throat, and he
kind of slumped forward, and then I couldn't tell where the second shot went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you were standing right along the curb on Elm Street, is
that right, when the motorcade came by across the street from the School
Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you follow the motorcade down Elm Street at all, or did
you stand on the corner up toward Houston Street and watch from there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I was right across from the sign that points to where Stemmons
Expressway is. I was directly across when the first shot hit him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Directly across from the sign that says, "Stemmons Freeway"?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I was right in line with the sign and the car, and I wasn't very
far away from him, but I couldn't tell from where the shot came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you just stay right there, or did you go on down Elm
Street?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I stayed there. I was on the corner across from the courthouse
when the motorcade first came down Main Street, and when it turned the corner
on Houston, well, I followed along the street with the car, and then he
turned the corner on Elm and I stood there where the Stemmons sign is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see the President get hit in the head?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You actually saw the President get hit that way?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How far away would you say that you were when you saw
that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Oh, about twice as far as I am from here to this door. Maybe
not quite that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About 25 feet or so?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. About that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now when you saw the President get hit in the head, did you
hear any more shots after that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes; the first one, I heard the first shot come and then he
slumped forward, and then I couldn't tell where the second shot went, and
then the third one, and that was the last one that hit him in the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You only heard three shots altogether?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes; that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you don't think there were any more shots after he got hit
in the head?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you recognize the noises that you heard as shots right
away?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. No; when the first shot rang out, I thought, well, it's probably
fireworks, because everybody is glad the President is in town. Then I realized
it was too loud and too close to be fireworks, and then when I saw, when I
realized that the President was falling over, I knew he had been hit. But I
didn't know how badly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Okay, I just wanted to ask you about whether you heard any
shots after the President got hit in the head, and if you didn't hear any more
shots, that is really all I wanted to ask you about. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. All right.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t499">TESTIMONY OF HELEN MARKHAM</h2>

<p>The testimony of Helen Markham was taken at 10 a.m., on July 23, 1364, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you stand and take the oath, please? Do you solemnly
swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler [spelling] L-i-e-b-e-l-e-r. I am
an attorney on the staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy. I have been authorized to take your testimony
for the Commission pursuant to authority granted it by the President in
Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and joint resolution of
Congress No. 137. I think you are somewhat familiar with the proceedings of
the Commission because you have already testified before the Commission in
Washington; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; but you know, I don't know nothing about the Kennedys&mdash;President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand you were there when Oswald shot Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Since you are familiar with the Commission's procedure, I'll
just go right into your testimony. I wanted to ask you some questions about
some of the things you told the Commission when you appeared before it on
March 26, 1964, when Mr. Ball took your testimony before the Commission.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember at that time that Mr. Ball asked you the
question, "Did you ever talk to a New York lawyer who said he was from New
York?" And that you answered, "No, sir." Mr. Ball then asked you, "Did you
ever talk to a lawyer who was investigating the case on behalf of the deceased
man, Lee Oswald?" Your answer was, "No, sir." Mr. Ball asked, "Did you ever
talk to a man who said he was representing the mother of Lee Oswald?" And
you answered, "No, sir." And then Mr. Ball asked you, "You don't remember
ever talking to a man named Mark Lane?" And then you answered, No, sir."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember giving that testimony at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever talked to Mark Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I haven't&mdash;I haven't never seen the man in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever talk to Mark Lane on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you remember that Congressman Ford specifically, and Mr.
Dulles, asked you whether or not you had talked to Mark Lane on the telephone
and you told them at that time that you had not talked to Mark Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir; I have never seen the man. If he was to come in here,
I wouldn't know who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, aside from the fact you have never seen the man, you also
told the Commission when you were in Washington that you had never talked
to him over the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you talked to Mark Lane over the telephone since you were
in Washington, before today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have never talked to Mark Lane over the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir; no, sir. Now, the old lady, and they told me they
were reporters, came to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right, but you have no recollection of ever talking to him
yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I never even talked to her even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, now, I'll tell you very frankly, that we have a tape recording
of a conversation that purports to be a conversation between you and Mark
Lane on the telephone and I have a transcript which we will mark as Markham
Exhibit No. <span class="locked">1&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Let me tell you <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I ask you to read the transcript and I will make arrangements&mdash;I
hadn't thought you would be here until 1 o'clock this afternoon, so I don't
have a tape recorder here, but I think I can have the Secret Service bring one
over. Would you like to hear the tape, so you can tell us whether or not that
is your voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me make arrangements then to have the Secret Service
bring the tape recorder on over and we will see if it is your voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I am going to tell you this, now, there was someone&mdash;let
me tell you this&mdash;there was someone one day&mdash;this was all to me&mdash;I was scared,
and I was, you know, frightened, and one day&mdash;now, this brings me back&mdash;the
memories [referring to the transcript heretofore mentioned]. One day on my
job there was someone that called, but he told me he was from the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That's right; the city hall down here, and this man told me
he was&mdash;now, I can tell you what he told me he was&mdash;he said he was Captain
Fritz&mdash;over this telephone&mdash;Capt. Will Fritz and I know you are familiar
with him, maybe. Now, he said he was Captain Fritz with the police department
of the city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, this transcript indicates that someone called a number,
a telephone number&mdash;do you remember the telephone number at your office
where you worked; were you working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; I was working down here on Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know what the telephone down there is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I have really forgotten it, but it was over this office
phone. It's a Riverside 8 number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there such a number as Matthew 7-6797?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or is there such a number as MA 7-6797, is there such a number
as that that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This transcript here indicates that some gentleman called this
number here, Matthew 7-6797.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. My number at home is Whitehall and this number that I
worked at was Riverside 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, I think what we should do is have the Secret Service
bring a tape recorder here, because I want you to listen to this conversation,
and if it is not your voice, we certainly want to know that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Sure, and this man&mdash;what this man told me&mdash;he told me he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
was from the Dallas Police Department and he said it was concerning the
Oswalds and they had to get a little more information from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, let me call the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. And listen, that was the only call that I know of. You see,
I kept racking my brain thinking back, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why don't we suspend momentarily and as soon as the Secret
Service man brings the tape recorder over here, which should be within a short
time, a half an hour, we will play the tape.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(At this point the proceedings were recessed and resumed at 11:40 a.m., as
follows:)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is Mr. John Joe Howlett with the Secret Service and he
has brought over the tape recorder and has put the tape on it and we will continue
with your deposition, Mrs. Markham. Mr. Howlett, with the U.S. Secret
Service, will operate the tape recorder and I will ask you, Mrs. Markham, to
listen to this conversation and tell us whether or not this is an accurate reflection
of a conversation that you had over the telephone some time ago?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Court Reporter</span>. How much of this tape recording do you want on the
record here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't want any of this on the record now; however, I will give
you, Mrs. Markham, a transcript of this telephone conversation to review and
follow along, if you will. This memorandum consists of 29 pages appearing on
the letterhead of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated July 16, 1964, and
I want you to see if that is not in fact a transcript, a typed copy of what is
on this tape.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; I'll watch this.</p>

<p>(At this point Mr. Howlett proceeded to play the tape recording of the telephone
conversation heretofore referred to and when the witness, Mrs. Markham,
began to indicate reactions to the recorded conversation, the reporter resumed
recording same as hereinafter shown and the record here begins with the question
and answer at the time Mrs. Markham began indicating her reactions.)</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I wonder if you would be good enough to tell me&mdash;I have your
affidavit which you gave the police on that date.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. And I have read that, of course, and I wonder if you would be
good enough to talk to me?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are shaking your head, as you listen to this tape recorder,
Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>John Joe, let's stop the recorder for a moment. What do you mean to indicate
by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I never talked to that man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that not your voice on the tape?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I can't tell about my voice, but that man&mdash;I never talked to
no woman or no man like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, we will play the recording some more, and are you following
it along, Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; I am right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And does this memorandum appear to be an accurate and exact
transcript of the recording?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That man&mdash;whoever that man is&mdash;I don't know, but it says,
Mark Lane. No, sir&mdash;I'll tell the truth (raising right hand) and those words
that he's saying&mdash;that's nothing like the telephone call I got&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's continue with the recording and see if you recognize your
voice here on the tape.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Tell me the description of the man whom you saw.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. This is an office business phone and I just can't tell you that."
I don't have the time to.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, could you just give me one moment and tell me&mdash;I read where
you told some of the reporters that he was short and stocky and had bushy hair.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, no; I did not say that.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. You did not say that?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Would you say that he was stocky?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He was short.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He was short?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. And was he a little on the heavy side?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Not too heavy.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Not too heavy, but slightly heavy?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, he was&mdash;no&mdash;he didn't look too heavy.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He wasn't too heavy and would you say that he had a rather
bushy kind of hair?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; that's my voice.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; just a little bit bushy.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It was a little bit bushy?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. Was there anybody else around when you saw this happen?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir; I didn't see anyone.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. There was no one else there. Did you ever have a chance to see
Mr. Oswald when he was alive, I mean after he was arrested, did they bring
you down to look at him?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I saw him on the lineup.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes. Did he look anything like the man who shot Oswald?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I identified him.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. You identified him as the man who did shoot him. Did anyone
point him out to you at that time as the man?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. In the lineup?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; they did not.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Did they tell you who it might be?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. They didn't tell me one thing.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. No. Do you recall what the gentleman was wearing who shot
Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. How was he dressed?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had on a light gray looking jacket.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Kind of dark trousers.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Dark trousers?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. And did you see what color shirt?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I could not.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The jacket was open or closed?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; it was zipped up a little bit&mdash;the neck was closed&mdash;pretty
close too.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, as I said, I have read your affidavit and it indicates the
police car stopped and then this man walked over to it and leaned on it and
placed his arms up against the car.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Up in the window.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. In the window?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. You didn't see the police officer call him over, did you?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; I seen the police car stop&mdash;I seen it all.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; I seen the police car stop.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. You heard the police car stop?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I seen it.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. You saw it stop and then Oswald or this gentleman, whoever it
was, walked over to the car?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; he walked over to the car.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. You didn't see the officer call him over, though, did you?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He rolled down the window.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. He did what?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He rolled down his window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. The officer rolled down the window?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Of course, you didn't put that in your affidavit.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. That was not in your affidavit.</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It should have been.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. It should have been&mdash;you told that to the officers?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; he had to have the window rolled down, because,
you see, he leaned over in the window.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I see. Now, did you tell the officers at the police station when
they questioned you, the description of the man who shot Tippit?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I told them that at the scene of the murder.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. You told the officers the description?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Did you say that he was short and a little bit on the heavy
side and had slightly bushy hair?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I did not. They didn't ask me that.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. They never asked you his description?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; they asked what he was wearing.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Just what he was wearing?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. But they never asked you how he was built or anything like that?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Well, you went to the police station where they took your affidavit,
right?</p>

<p>"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you are shaking your head at this point.</p>

<p>Miss Reporter, you are taking the transcript down.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Reporter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, at this point you were shaking your head, what do you
mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. This man&mdash;I have never talked with. This lady was never
on the telephone. This man that called me like I told you, he told me he was
from the city hall, the police department, the police department of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, now, do you remember having this conversation with
somebody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; I do, but he told me he was from the police department
of city hall and he had to get some information, a little more information from
me. That was my boss that told me&mdash;the one that said, "Wait a minute," that
was my boss, Mr. Sam Gambolus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you received this call at the place where you work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember specifically that when the telephone calls
started, that this man told you he was from the city hall of the police department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; yes, sir; right. Because&mdash;you see&mdash;I had got a call
from a man, but it was&mdash;I found out later, because the lady had called me back,
it was from Mr. Tippit's sister, and I had told them that I couldn't talk, you
know, I was busy on my job and this man told me that he was from the police
department of the city hall and he had to get a little more information and it
wouldn't take much of my time, and so I got permission from this boss, Mr.
Gambolus, to talk with this man. Now, he told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did he tell you he was from the police department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, on this tape recording right here, this man is asking you
what the police did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he said they&mdash;the police took you and took your affidavit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That man&mdash;I have never talked to that man. I talked to
a man that was supposed to have been from the police department of the city
hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize this as the voice of the man you talked to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is not the same voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you explain the fact that the woman's voice on this
tape recording is your voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I never heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never heard the man's voice before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. And I never heard this lady's voice before&mdash;this is the first
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any doubt in your mind at all that the lady's voice
on the tape now is your voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It is my voice, but this man told me he was from the city
police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it occur to you as you were talking to him&mdash;when he said,
for example, on the tape here just a few minutes ago, did you tell the officers&mdash;you
told this person you were talking to on this tape that you saw the police
car stop and that this man walked over to the car and that the officer had rolled
the window down and this man's voice said you did not put in the affidavit that
you had seen the officer roll the window down.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Man, I have never heard such a thing as this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the bottom of page 6 he says, "I see. Now, did you tell the
officers at the police station, when they questioned you, the description of the
man who shot Tippit?"</p>

<p>You couldn't have thought he was from the police department if he was asking
you what you were telling the police before&mdash;do you agree with me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; but he told me he was from the police department and
he had to get some information from me and I wanted to get back to my work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, it is your testimony that even though you engaged in this
conversation here, the man&mdash;when he started out, he told you that he was from
the police department; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; I wouldn't have never talked to this man. Just like
if I get a telephone call I say, "You know where I am at, come down to see me."
He told me he was from the police department and this lady never talked to
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which lady is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. On this tape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which lady on the tape?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It was a woman talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The lady's voice that was talking on the tape here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I thought that was your voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Not at the first there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Not at the first&mdash;you mean the telephone operator, the one that
was the telephone operator? The tape here indicates that the long-distance
telephone operator or some telephone operator called you to the telephone and
a man answered the telephone.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; my boss called me to the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, when you came to the telephone it was this man on the
telephone and he told you that he was from the police department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then you engaged in this telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; he certainly did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that, in fact, your testimony is that you had never had anybody
introduce themselves to you as Mark Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you haven't talked to him over the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir; and so help me [raising right hand] I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't have any doubt, however, that you did engage in this
particular conversation, except that you are having trouble at the beginning and
end of it because you said that the man told you that he was from the police
department when he called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; he certainly did. I know he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever tell anybody that this man who shot Officer Tippit
was short and stocky and had bushy hair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No. [Handed instruments to Mr. Liebeler.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have brought a couple of pieces of paper here that you
want me to look at?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Please&mdash;this here doesn't make sense and let me show you&mdash;I
don't know what to think about it, but I got this, but my daughter wouldn't
let me have it because I was very upset at the time and I don't know what it
even means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let the record show that the witness has handed me a piece of
paper, a single sheet of paper enclosed in an envelope of the Statler-Hilton
Hotel in Dallas and postmarked Dallas, Tex., July 11, 1964, and addressed to Mrs.
Helen Markham at 328 East Ninth Street in Dallas, and the letter has a return
address of P.O. Box 2897, Dallas 21, Tex. It is dated July 10, 1964, and it is
addressed to Mrs. Markham and it says, "At your convenience, would you
kindly call me Saturday or any weekday morning between 9 a.m. and 12 noon.
I would like the opportunity of discussing a matter which I believe will be
mutually profitable. Sincerely, James Kerr."</p>

<p>We will mark the envelope and the letter as Markham Deposition Exhibit
No. 2. I have marked the letter as indicated and I have put my initials on it
and would you put your initials on it, Mrs. Markham, so we don't have any
trouble identifying it in the future.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Just my initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; just your initials.</p>

<p>(Mrs. Markham initials instrument referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you ever call this Mr. Kerr?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Now, where at&mdash;there wasn't no telephone or nothing. It
gives a post office box is all I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never looked the telephone number up in the book or anything
like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I didn't. There are so many Kerrs&mdash;you never know
who it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, the envelope has the telephone listing on it&mdash;RI 9-3195;
did you notice that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, I called that number off of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whose number that is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I believe it was either the police department&mdash;I don't
know, but I called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You also have a telegram you want me to look at?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never did talk to this Mr. Kerr; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir; that's all I've gotten. I want you to see what you
think about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The witness has produced a telegram dated July 21, apparently
1964, and addressed to her, which reads as follows:</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Markham:</p>

<p>"The United States Information Agency is preparing a televised report on
the findings of the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>"To aid us in our objectives, we have requested the on-camera presence of
President Johnson, the Commission members and selected witnesses who have
given testimony here in Washington. We would like to request your cooperation
in appearing on our program. In our opinion, your presence and perhaps
a statement of your feeling and of your feelings in truthful note and fashion
will serve to alleviate the tension and misgivings following the death of
Officer Tippit and, of course, the other Dallas tragedies. I would be most
anxious to have your reaction and will contact you personally concerning our
request.</p>

<p>"I look forward to talking with you.</p>

<p>"Sincerely, Buck Richard Pennington, Producer, Television Service U.S. Information
Agency, Washington 25, D.C., phone Worth 2-0319."</p>

<p>When did you receive this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Just a moment, I talked to Mrs. Markham about this&mdash;she called
me on the telephone about that. The U.S. Information Agency is a legitimate
Government organization and they are planning to do this. They have contacted
us to assist them in the location of some witnesses and we checked with our
office in Washington and they came back and told us it was a legitimate venture,
but we were, the Secret Service, was engaged with the Commission and that
we wouldn't be able to help, but it is supposed to be a legitimate operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you have discussed this with Agent Howlett, is that right,
as he indicated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Now, this man&mdash;Buck Pennington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He called me right after I got this telegram and whatever
you think&mdash;he wanted me to come up there Monday or Tuesday. Do you think it
would be all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, neither one of us is in a position to give you any advice
on that at all, Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, who do I go to? I don't want to do something wrong.
I've done talked to somebody, I didn't know who I was talking to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I suggest you write a little note to Mr. Rankin, general counsel
of the Commission's staff in Washington and ask him what he thinks you should
do.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Would you write that address down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you give her that address, Joe? Afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. That's Mr. Rankin's address in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I don't know if it would be all right to go up there and do
that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, why don't you write to Mr. Rankin and he will handle
that aspect of it.</p>

<p>Now, I want to mark this transcript, Mrs. Markham, and we have listened
to the tape&mdash;not all the way through, but part of the way through, to about page
6, and you followed it through to that extent, have you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you are satisfied that to the extent we have listened to the
tape, that it is accurately set forth in this memorandum?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; but that man is wrong. Why would anybody want to
do anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you put your initials on that memorandum, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; may I use a pencil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I just wrote Markham down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All right. Thank you very much, Mrs. Markham. I don't
have any other questions at this time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, that just worries me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, we will have to do further investigation into this.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Because he told me he was from the police department.
It never dawned on me. You know, I was in a hurry to get back because I
was going to get fired if I didn't get back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you very much, Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, will I get in any trouble over this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think so, Mrs. Markham. I wouldn't worry about it.
I don't think anybody is going to cause you any trouble over that [referring
to the telegram].</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That was dirty in that man doing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That was dirty in that man doing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, I would think that's right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, he's not no better than Oswald&mdash;that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you, Mrs. Markham, very much.</p>

<h2 id="t507">TESTIMONY OF MRS. DONALD BAKER</h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Donald Baker was taken at 11:50 a.m., on July 22,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before you sit down, will you raise your right hand and please
take the oath? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to
give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Baker, my name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am an attorney
on the staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of
President Kennedy. I have been authorized to take your testimony by the
Commission, pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order 11130,
dated November 29, 1963, and the joint resolution of Congress No. 137. Under
the rules of the Commission, you are entitled to have an attorney present
and you are entitled to 3 days' notice of the hearing. You don't have to
answer any questions that you think would violate any of your constitutional
rights. I presume from the nature of the testimony that we are going to ask
you about that you don't want your attorney present and that you are willing to
proceed with the testimony at this point; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Mrs. Donald Baker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you been married since the 22d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. February 1, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were married on February 1, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you Virgie Rachley or is that somebody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That's me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How come I have your name as Virgie Rachley and also Mrs.
Donald S. Baker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, I have a report from the FBI that is dated November 24,
1963, and they refer to you as Virgie Rachley in that report, but you had already
been married at that time; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I married this year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oh, February of 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This is 1964&mdash;I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's right. Now, we've got it. You were Virgie Rachley on
November 24, 1963, and you were married in February 1964.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you were employed at the time of the assassination
as a bookkeeper at the Texas School Book Depository; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long had you worked there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, I have been there since July 16, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Last year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald or have occasion to see
him while you were employed at the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I had seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had seen him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had you ever said anything to him or talked to him at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any impression of him just from seeing him around
the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Just that he was awful quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than that, did you form any impression of him at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell me what happened on the 22d of November in connection
with the motorcade, would you please, what you saw and what you did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, we came out of the building across the street at approximately
12 or 12:15 and we stood out in front, directly in front of the Depository
Building and as the motorcade came by the President waved and he got <span class="locked">down&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you standing at this point, at the time the motorcade
came along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, there is a divisional line&mdash;I don't know exactly what you
would call it&mdash;the little part of the street that runs in front of the Depository
and then there is&mdash;I don't know what you would call it&mdash;the grassy stuff that
comes out to form the plaza along the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say there is a little street that runs immediately in front of
the School Book Depository Building; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know if that street has a name or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I'm sure it doesn't&mdash;I have never seen one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then after that little street that runs right in front of
the Depository Building, there is a little strip of grass with some trees on it; is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then comes Elm Street; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And on the other side of Elm Street there is a sort of a
triangular plot of grass.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I guess you could say we were standing just at the edge of Elm
Street at the side of the Depository because we were out almost in the street&mdash;Elm
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Elm Street is separated from another street that runs down
through the triple underpass. Do you know the name of that street that runs
right down here&mdash;I am showing you Commission Exhibit No. 354, an aerial
view of the street that runs by and three streets converge and go under the
railroad tracks and that's the triple underpass.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I think that goes out to Stemmons Expressway or leads into
Stemmons Expressway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The street that runs right down through here, the middle, is
that Main Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That would be Main Street and this one would be Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, can you point to me approximately where you were
standing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Let me find the building here&mdash;it would be right here&mdash;we were
standing right at the edge, approximately directly in front of the building or
at the edge of the building; we were standing right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you were standing directly in front of the Texas School
Book Depository Building and on the same side of Elm Street that the Texas
School Book Depository is located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell me what you saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, after he passed us, then we heard a noise and I thought
it was firecrackers, because I saw a shot or something hit the pavement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you heard that immediately after the first noise; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you tell or did you have any idea where the noise came
from when you first heard it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No; I thought there were some boys standing down there where
he was&mdash;where the President's car was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Down farther on the street, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes; close to the underpass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had the President's car already passed you at the time you
heard the first noise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me approximately how far down the street it had
gone when you heard the first shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I don't know exactly&mdash;I could still see the back of the car&mdash;I
can't judge distance so I really couldn't tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It hadn't gone out of sight in your opinion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you still see the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Not too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is a gradual curve on Elm Street and the car had already
started slightly into the curve by the time it had gone by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say you saw something hit the street after you heard the
first shot; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you see it hit the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Have you got that&mdash;can you see the signs on that picture there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, you can't see the signs too well on that picture, which is
Commission Exhibit No. 354, but I will show you some other pictures here
on which the signs do appear. First of all, let me show you Hudson Exhibit
No. 1 on which appears a sign that says, "Stemmons Freeway, Keep Right."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you see that sign?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Stemmons Freeway sign from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No; I couldn't see the sign because I was angled&mdash;we were stepping
out in the street then and it was approximately along in here, I presume,
the first sign&mdash;I don't know which one it is, but I saw the bullet hit on down
this way, I guess, right at the sign, angling out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think the bullet hit the street, only it was farther out in
the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Even though you couldn't see the sign, you could see this thing
hit the street near the sign?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It appears to me from looking at Commission Exhibit No. 354,
that you can in fact make out where the signs are located along the side of the
road and let's see if these do look like the signs. Now, as you come down Elm
Street past the place you were standing going toward the triple underpass, there
is a tree here on this little grassy triangular spot that is on the side of Elm
Street toward the Texas School Book Depository Building, right on Dealey
Plaza here by this concrete structure. Then, after the tree, going on down
toward the triple underpass, it appears in the aerial photograph&mdash;a spot that
looks like a sign or a shadow&mdash;it looks like a sign to me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. There is a sign there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then there's another sign farther on down there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This was a big sign here and there was a small one here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you think that it was approximately near the first sign?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I can remember, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As you went down Elm Street that you saw this thing hit the
street&mdash;what did it look like when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, as I said, I thought it was a firecracker. It looked just
like you could see the sparks from it and I just thought it was a firecracker
and I was thinking that there was somebody was fixing to get in a lot of
trouble and we thought the kids or whoever threw it were down below or
standing near the underpass or back up here by the sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would they have been as far down as the underpass or somewhere
near the sign to have thrown a firecracker in the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It was near the signs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How close to the curb on Elm Street was this thing you saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
hit; do you remember? It would have been on the curb side&mdash;near the curb
side away from the Texas School Book Depository Building on the opposite
side of the street; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How close to the opposite curb do you think it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It was approximately in the middle of the lane&mdash;I couldn't be
quite sure, but I thought it was in the middle or somewhere along in there. I
could even be wrong about that but I could have sworn it that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You thought it was sort of toward the middle of the lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Toward the middle of the lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of the left-hand lane going toward the underpass; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was the thing that you saw hit the street in relation
to the President's car? I mean, was it in front of the car, behind his car, by
the side of his car or was it close to the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I thought it was&mdash;well&mdash;behind it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had the car already gone by when you saw this thing hit in
the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether it hit toward the left-hand side
or the right-hand side of the President's car, or was it just immediately behind
it? If you can't remember it that closely, all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I can't remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you actually see the President get hit by any bullets?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you first become aware that they were shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. With the second shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any idea where they were coming from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, the way it sounded&mdash;it sounded like it was coming from&mdash;there
was a railroad track that runs behind the building&mdash;there directly behind
the building and around, so I guess it would be by the underpass, the triple
underpass, and there is a railroad track that runs back out there and there
was a train that looked like a circus train as well as I can remember now, back
there, and we all ran to the plaza&mdash;the little thing there I guess you call it a
plaza&mdash;back behind there&mdash;this other girl and I almost ran back over there
and looked and we didn't see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say the plaza, you mean Dealey Plaza, the area that
lies between Elm Street and this little street that runs by the Texas School
Book Depository Building; is that correct? Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you heard the shots, you ran down the little street that
runs in front of the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Along the grass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Along the grass&mdash;alongside there, running toward the triple
underpass where Elm Street goes, but you were actually running down the little
street or alongside the street on the grass, alongside the street that runs right
in front of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you say there are some railroad tracks back in there; is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Immediately behind Dealey Plaza away from Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And is that where you thought the shots came from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And when you went down there and looked, did you see anybody
at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Just a policeman and several people were down there around the

Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't see anybody you thought might have been the
assassin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you have subsequently heard, I'm sure, and from reading
in the newspapers and one thing and another, that it appears that the shots actually
came from the Texas School Book Depository Building; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Does that seem possible to you in view of what you heard at
the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, I guess it might have been the wind, but to me it didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The sounds you heard at the time did not appear to come from
the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you look up at the Texas School Book Depository Building
at all while you were standing there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you had no occasion to see anybody in any of the windows
in that building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. According to the FBI report of the interview that you gave
them on November 24, you said that just after the shooting some man who had
been sitting on a wall directly across the street from you came up and said he
saw everything; is that so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever find out what that man's name was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I did not. I didn't see him after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what he had seen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No; I don't remember&mdash;he came over&mdash;I don't know when he
came over now, but he told us he had seen everything&mdash;it might have been later
that afternoon. I think it was&mdash;I think it was later that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you where he had been, where he could see all this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He said he was sitting on that wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, when you say "that wall" I show you again Commission
Exhibit No. 354.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This wall here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you referring to a wall that is on the triangular spot
formed by Elm Street and Main Street and across Elm Street from the Texas
School Book Depository Building? And on Commission Exhibit No. 354; that
area has some ink marks on it around part of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did this man tell you exactly where on the wall he had been
sitting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No; I presume it was on this high wall here&mdash;it sticks up real
high&mdash;I presume he was up there on top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have indicated the part of the wall that faces toward the
triple underpass down toward where Elm Street and Main Street and Commerce
all come together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, there has been some speculation that perhaps the shots
might have come from right off the triple overpass, from the railroad tracks
that go up over the top, were you able to see these railroad tracks at the time
from where you were standing down here&mdash;when I say, "Down here," I mean
the railroad tracks that actually go over Elm Street and Main Street and
Commerce.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You could not see that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the shots sound like they had come from that area, or
did they sound like they had come from the area more around toward the
Texas School Book Depository Building and behind Dealey Plaza?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It sounded like it was coming from along in here&mdash;it didn't sound
like it was too far off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It didn't sound like it was coming, however, directly from
the railroad tracks that go over Elm, Main, and Commerce; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The FBI report also indicates that after the second shot you
began to smell gunsmoke; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you tell where it was coming from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Looking at Commission Exhibit No. 354, could you pick out the
place on Elm Street as the approximate place where you saw this object hit
the ground for us, and we will mark it with a pen or pencil. Let's first of all
mark the place where you were standing, Mrs. Baker, if we can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Okay, after he had gone by, I got out into the street, I guess,
along in here in the middle of the lanes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that in the middle of the right-hand lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes; the right-hand lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, we will mark that as No. 1 and we will put a circle around
it and its right in front of the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On Elm Street in the right-hand lane.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And I guess that this tree was along in here somewhere?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There appear to be two trees, one on this side of Elm Street&mdash;this
looks like a tree right here on the opposite side of Elm Street toward the
Dealey Plaza.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And across the street&mdash;across Elm Street there appears to be
another tree just down from the wall.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. There's not a tree there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There's not a tree there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, there's a sign there, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's a sign.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us by judging from the tree that's in the corner
of Dealey Plaza closest towards the School Book Depository Building, judging
from that, where the thing hit the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Approximately right here&mdash;between the sign and the tree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right here, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have indicated the approximate area where you think it
hit and we will indicate it by the No. 2, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have marked this photograph, Baker Exhibit No. 1, and I have
placed my initials on it and would you put your initials on it just below mine
so that we can identify the picture for the purposes of our record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. [Complied with request of Mr. Liebeler.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you look at that picture and see if you can tell from it
where you were standing and if that helped you to place the spot where the
bullet hit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It would be back in here behind this car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would have been where you were standing or where the
bullet hit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I really can't tell for the tree there and everything&mdash;but it
was right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, as we look at this picture this is Baker Exhibit No. 1,
starting from the left front, there are&mdash;there is a car down there and there is
a Volkswagen panel truck in the picture and then there are two cars immediately
behind the Volkswagen and then there is a convertible out&mdash;approximately
in the middle of the street, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you think you might have been standing somewhere behind
the spot where that convertible is located in this picture; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Either there or right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right in back around the second car behind the Volkswagen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, this picture actually shows the little grassy area and the
trees that lie between Elm Street and the little street that runs in front of the
Texas School Book Depository, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you give me an estimate, looking at this picture, where
that thing might have hit the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It may not be in this picture&mdash;I don't know that it is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I just can't tell&mdash;I would say it was over in here somewhere in
this picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Somewhere in about here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It could have been further on up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, we will mark the place "X", but you think it might have
been right along here or somewhere farther down. Now, is there a concrete
divider somewhere here on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Not until you pass the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Not until you get down here towards the underpass and then
there are concrete dividers here between Elm Street and Main Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Back up here toward the intersection at Houston Street, there
is a curb on the side of Elm Street and that's all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In other words, you turn down from Houston Street and go
right on down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You saw this thing hit the street before you heard the second
shot; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you absolutely sure of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I hope I am&mdash;I know I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In marking the "X" on Baker Exhibit No. 1 that we marked,
we were assuming, were we not, that the "X" was fairly near the first sign on
the right-hand side of Elm Street going toward the triple underpass after the
Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I think that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think that we will find that the "X" is&mdash;well, it is very difficult
to tell the exact spot from which Baker Exhibit No. 1 was taken, but if
in fact we are correct, if in fact it is taken from the side of Main Street toward
Commerce Street, then the "X" would not be in the right place, would it, if this
lampost here that appears in the picture is actually at the end of the grassy
spot made by Main Street and Elm Street, then the "X" that we have on Baker
Exhibit No. 1 would be too far down toward the Triple Underpass to be in the
right place where you saw it hit, isn't that right; do you follow me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because, if this is actually the end of this grassy spot, if the
lamppost is actually the end of the grassy spot here between Elm Street and Main
Street, this "X" is very close to the Triple Underpass.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't see the bullet hit that far down the street, did
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No; not that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It would have been much closer, up towards the Texas School
Book Depository Building&mdash;near the first sign?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This right here are the steps&mdash;to the plaza.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's right, and as a point of fact, as we look at that now,
it becomes quite clear that it was taken from a spot much closer to the triple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
underpass than we had originally thought, because in the left-hand side of the
picture you can see the steps coming down from the plaza.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It must have been right here in this area because these were the
steps&mdash;I can't tell which sign is which, but I know there were four girls standing
near the sign and it must have been back up here because there must have been
another sign closer up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Looking at Hudson Exhibit No. 1, which was taken at the
time of the assassination, it shows Dealey Plaza here and there are some steps
that go down over here in the very background of the picture and they go down
onto the sidewalk and it runs along past Elm Street here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This would be the first sign here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Stemmons Freeway sign.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This one over here&mdash;the steps are already here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; the steps are toward the background in Hudson Exhibit
No. 1 and those appear to be the steps that are also toward the front left of
Baker Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It was probably back over this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, so the "X" on Baker Exhibit No. 1 is actually in the wrong
place as far as these pictures here&mdash;it is not correct&mdash;it should be further back
on up here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes; definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, we will put a "Y" back up here toward the School Book
Depository Building, and actually if you look at Commission Exhibit No. 354,
you can see the steps coming right down to Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the end of Dealey Plaza toward the Triple Underpass, and I
think that those steps are the same steps we can see in the left front foreground
of Baker Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That's the sign right in there&mdash;that big sign there, and I don't
know&mdash;the sign would be here, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's right, and the sign that we see in the very left front
foreground of the picture would be the sign here that is toward the Triple Underpass
from the steps to go down to Dealey Plaza on the right-hand side of Elm
Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes; this is confusing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In any event, you are quite clear in your mind that you saw
this thing hit before you heard the second shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, if what you saw hitting the street was, in fact, a bullet, it
would have been the first shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anything else around the area of the Texas School
Book Depository Building that day that you think might have anything to do
with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I don't know, but before the parade ever got there, someone
passed out and I guess it would be to the left, coming down Elm Street over in
this plaza between Elm Street and Main, because an ambulance pulled up and
picked someone up&mdash;we never could tell who. This was before the motorcade
ever got to Houston Street&mdash;I would say onto Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About how long before the motorcade came did this ambulance
come and pick up this person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I'll judge&mdash;5 minutes&mdash;about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The ambulance had already left the area about 5 minutes before
the Presidential motorcade came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What time did you come to work that morning; do you
remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, it could have been 6:30 or 7, because I rode with daddy;
my daddy works behind the Depository for the Katy Railroad and if he had
to be there at 6, then I got there at 6, but that morning, I couldn't tell you, but
whatever time daddy had to be at work, that's when I had to be there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Oswald on the morning of November 22 at any
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Billy Lovelady?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit No. 203, and I call your attention
to a man standing in the doorway of the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That looks like Billy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That looks like Billy Lovelady?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that man you pointed to is immediately as we face the
picture to the right of the mark "A" in the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And is standing directly against the side of the doorway of
the building&mdash;of the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you. If you don't have anything else you would like to
tell us about this that you think we should know and that I haven't asked you,
I have no other questions at this point.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t515">TESTIMONY OF JAMES W. ALTGENS</h2>

<p>The testimony of James W. Altgens was taken at 12:45 p.m., on July 22, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney. 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you please stand and take the oath. Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Altgens, my name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am an attorney
on the staff of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy. I have been authorized to take your testimony by the Commission,
pursuant to authority granted to it by President Johnson's Executive Order
No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the joint resolution of Congress No. 137.
Under the rules of the Commission's proceedings you are entitled to have an
attorney present if you want one. If you don't think you need one, it's perfectly
all right. You are entitled to 3 days' notice and you may actually have gotten
3 days' notice, but if you did not, I presume you are prepared to go ahead, since
you are here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes; as a matter of fact I had more than 3 days' notice because
the time that was originally set up was postponed for almost an additional week,
so I had plenty of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. James W. Altgens [spelling], A-l-t-g-e-n-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. 6441 Pemberton [spelling], P-e-m-b-e-r-t-o-n Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes; Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you employed here in Dallas at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In what capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Officially, I am hired as a wire photo operator, but they use
me in three different classifications. I am a photographer and a news photo
editor as well as a wire photo operator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By whom are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. The Associated Press, Dallas Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been employed by the AP?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Approximately 26½ Years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So one might say you are an experienced photographer and
have a little experience in the area of photographic work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I would assume so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you born, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. April 28, 1919.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Here; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you lived most of your life here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. All except my service connected time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have been advised that on November 22, 1963, you were
assigned to take pictures of the Presidential motorcade; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us the circumstances surrounding the taking
of the picture or pictures that you did take and just what happened, where
you were and all that you know about the events of November the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Would you like for me to take it from the time that I arrived
on the scene up until the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I arrived on the triple overpass at approximately 11:15 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say the triple overpass, you mean the railroad tracks
that cross over Elm, Commerce, and Main Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As they run near the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. As well as in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. My original assignment was to make a pictorial scene of the
caravan with the Dallas skyline in the background and the triple overpass was
selected as the site for making that picture, and when I arrived on the triple
overpass there was no one up there but two uniformed policemen and one of
the uniformed policemen came over to me and asked me if I was a railroad
employee and I told him, "No," and I showed him my press tag and told him I
had a Department of Public Safety ID card showing I was connected with the
AP&mdash;Associated Press, and he said, "Well, I'm sorry, but this is private property.
It belongs to the railroad and only railroad employees are permitted on
this property." And, I explained to him that this was a public event and I
thought I would be privileged to make a picture from that area, and he says,
"No. This is private property and no one but railroad personnel are permitted
in this area."</p>

<p>This is a little extraneous but I wanted to point this out, and I said, "Well,
it looks like you have got it pretty well protected from this area because I see
you two uniformed policemen on this overpass and I see you have another
uniformed policeman on the overpass on Stemmons," and he said, "Yes, and no
one is permitted over on that overpass." So, then, I had to decide on another
location for shooting my pictures, so I proceeded on across the triple overpass
into the parking lot which is just behind the Book Depository Building and
proceeded on down to Elm to the corner of Elm and Houston, crossed Elm
going&mdash;is that east or south&mdash;I guess it is south on Houston. Yes; south on
Houston over to Main and Houston. That seemed to me to be the most likely
spot to make any pictures. Then I could, by advance planning, get away from
that spot after I had made a picture or two and run across the Dealey Plaza
and catch the caravan again down on Elm as it proceeded toward the triple
overpass and probably get some more pictures, and that was my planning.</p>

<p>Well, I was at that site when the Presidential caravan arrived at that
intersection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That intersection being the intersection of Houston and Elm
Streets?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Houston and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Houston and Main?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes; Houston and Main. When the caravan reached Houston
and Main I made at least one shot&mdash;one picture&mdash;I don't have the roll of film
with me now so I don't know exactly, but I know I had made an additional
one or two pictures of the caravan coming down Main Street prior to that, but
I got the one picture with the President waving into the camera. Mrs. Kennedy
was looking at me at the time, just as I got ready to snap it the north wind
caught her hat and almost blew it off, so she raised her left hand to grab her
hat and I did not get her looking into the camera, but I got the Governor and
Mrs. Connally and the President with the President waving into the camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was as they turned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. This was as they turned into the sunlight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Turning into Houston Street; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Turning right&mdash;headed toward the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I thereupon grabbed my gadget bag that I carry my extra lenses
in and ran fast down across the Dealey Plaza to get down in front of the
caravan for some additional pictures and I took this one <span class="locked">picture&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Wait just a minute now&mdash;at this point, as you ran across, you
were along Elm Street; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, I ran across and reached up into&mdash;well, the curb area on
the west side of Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Across Elm Street from the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; and if I had a picture I could probably show you exactly
where I was standing. I did show it to Agent Switzer, if that would be of
any help to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; I would like to locate that spot. I show you Exhibit No.
354, which is an aerial view of the area that we have been discussing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. This is the Book Depository Building, correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(The witness points to the School Book Depository Building.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. This would put me at approximately this area here, which
would be about 15 feet from me at the time he was shot in the head&mdash;about 15
feet from the car on the west side of the car&mdash;on the side that Mrs. Kennedy
was riding in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have indicated a spot along the side of Elm Street which
I have marked with a No. 3; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I that approximately where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, when you took the picture of the caravan turning from
Main Street to the right on Houston Street, you then ran across this Dealey
Plaza?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Down this way; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Along the lawn part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the point marked No. 3 on Commission Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And at that point did you take another picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I made one picture at the time I heard a noise that sounded
like a firecracker&mdash;I did not know it was a shot, but evidently my picture, as I
recall, and it was almost simultaneously with the shot&mdash;the shot was just a fraction
ahead of my picture, but that much of course&mdash;at that time I figured it was
nothing more than a firecracker, because from my position down here the sound
was not of such volume that it would indicate to me it was a high-velocity rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any idea where the sound came from when you
were standing there at No. 3 on Commission Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, it sounded like it was coming up from behind the car from
my position&mdash;I mean the first shot, and being fireworks&mdash;who counts fireworks
explosions? I wasn't keeping track of the number of pops that took place, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
I could vouch for No. 1, and I can vouch for the last shot, but I cannot tell
you how many shots were in between. There was not another shot fired after
the President was struck in the head. That was the last shot&mdash;that much I
will say with a great degree of certainty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What makes you so certain of that, Mr. Altgens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Because, having heard these shots and then having seen the
damage that was done on this shot to the President's head, I was aware at
that time that shooting was taking place and there was not a shot&mdash;I looked&mdash;I
looked because I knew the shot had to come from either over here, if it were
close range, or had to come from a high-powered rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say "over here," you indicate what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. The left side of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would be approximately the intersection of Elm Street
and the little street that runs down in front of the Texas School Book Depository
Building; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Somewhere in that direction, yes, sir. But if it were a pistol
it would have to be fired at close range for any degree of accuracy and there
was no one in that area that I could see with any firearms, so I looked back up
in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Indicating the buildings surrounding the intersection of Houston
Street and Elm Street; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes. What made me almost certain that the shot came from
behind was because at the time I was looking at the President, just as he was
struck, it caused him to move a bit forward. He seemed as if at the time&mdash;well,
he was in a position&mdash;sort of immobile. He wasn't upright. He was at
an angle but when it hit him, it seemed to have just lodged&mdash;it seemed as if he
were hung up on a seat button or something like that. It knocked him just
enough forward that he came right on down. There was flesh particles that
flew out of the side of his head in my direction from where I was standing,
so much so that it indicated to me that the shot came out of the left side of
his head. Also, the fact that his head was covered with blood, the hairline
included, on the left side&mdash;all the way down, with no blood on his forehead
or face&mdash;suggested to me, too, that the shot came from the opposite side, meaning
in the direction of this Depository Building, but at no time did I know for
certain where the shot came from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because you didn't see who fired it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Because I didn't see who fired it. After the Presidential car
moved a little past me, I took another picture&mdash;now, just let me back up here&mdash;I
was prepared to make a picture at the very instant the President was shot.
I had refocused to 15 feet because I wanted a good closeup of the President
and Mrs. Kennedy, and that's why I know that it would be right at 15 feet,
because I had prefocused in that area, and I had my camera almost to my eye
when it happened and that's as far as I got with my camera.</p>

<p>Because, you see, even up to that time I didn't know that the President had
been shot previously. I still thought up until that time that all I heard was
fireworks and that they were giving some sort of celebration to the President
by popping these fireworks. It stunned me so at what I saw that I failed to do
my duty and make the picture that I was hoping to make.</p>

<p>The car never did stop. It was proceeding along in a slow pace and I stepped
out in the curb area and made another picture as the Secret Service man stepped
upon the rear step of the Presidential car and went to Mrs. Kennedy's aid and
then after that I immediately crossed the street and once again I was looking to
see if I could find anything in this area of Elm and Houston Streets that would
suggest to me where the shot came from.</p>

<p>Moreover, I was interested in knowing whether or not somebody else had
been struck by a bullet or one of the bullets in this area. I saw that no one
else had been hit. I did notice after I got on this side of the street, that would
be on the opposite side of the Presidential car from where I was standing originally,
which would be the left side of the car from where I was standing&mdash;looking
up toward the building&mdash;I saw people looking out of windows. I saw
a couple of Negroes looking out of a window which I later learned was the
floor below where the gun&mdash;where the sniper's nest was supposed to have been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
but it didn't register on me at the time that they were looking from an area
that the bullet might have come from. There was utter confusion at the time
I crossed the street. The Secret Service men, uniformed policemen with drawn
guns that went racing up this little incline and I <span class="locked">thought&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you speak of "little incline" that means the area&mdash;the
little incline on the grassy area here by this concrete structure across Elm
Street toward the School Book Depository Building, is that part of Dealey
Plaza too over in here, this concrete structure, or is Dealey Plaza only the
name ascribed to this area here between Elm Street and Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I really don't know, sir&mdash;I don't know whether this is considered
part of the Dealey Plaza or whether this is just something extra as
you might have for dressing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The part we are referring to that we are not just sure if it
is a part of Dealey Plaza lies between Elm Street and the railroad tracks that
run behind it over here and from the railroad tracks that go over the triple
underpass, and this little grassy area that you have just mentioned is just
between the area formed by Elm Street and the street that runs directly in
front of the School Book Depository Building; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I started up the incline with&mdash;or, after the officers, because they were moving
well ahead of me and I was moving behind them thinking perhaps if they had
the assassin cornered I wanted a picture, but before I had gotten over one-quarter
of the way up the incline, I met the officers coming back and I presumed
that they were just chasing shadows, so to speak, because there was no
assassin in the area apparently, but I didn't learn the location of the sniper's
nest until I was en route out to Parkland Hospital to continue my assignment
and I heard it on the radio, that the assassin's nest was in the sixth floor
window of the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>After that I made a good look through this area to see that no one else
had been hit. I noticed the couple that were on the ground over here with
their children, I saw them when they went down and they were in the area
and laid there some time after the Presidential car had disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They threw themselves on the ground in this grassy area that
I have just described previously where you ran across after this last shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes; but they were not hit. I looked at them and they weren't
hit by a bullet, so I took another long look around before I started my dash
back to the office, and as it turned out, my report was the first that our service
had on the assassination and my pictures were the only pictures we had available
for a period of about 24 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have a picture here which has been marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 203 and I ask you if that is not the first picture that you took after
you left the intersection of Main and Houston and crossed Dealey Plaza and
stood on the side of Elm Street across from the Texas School Book Depository
Book Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize that as the picture which you took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know any of the individuals depicted in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You testified previously, I believe, that the first shot that was
fired had just been fired momentarily before you took the picture, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; it was so close you could almost say it was simultaneous
because it was coincidental but nevertheless that's just the way it
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you first heard this shot, did you see any reaction
either on the part of the President or anyone else that indicated they might
have been hit by this shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. No, sir; and as a matter of fact, I did not know that Governor
Connally had been hit until one of our reporters got the information out at
Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As the Presidential car went down Elm Street, did you observe
Governor Connally's movements at all, did you see what he was doing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. No, sir; my attention was primarily on the President and Mrs.
Kennedy and I just wasn't paying too much attention about the other people
in the car after what I saw happen. Of course, my concern was about the
President and I just wasn't paying too much attention to others in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are quite sure in your mind, however, that there were no
shots, a noise that sounded like shots, prior to the time at which you took the
picture that has been marked Commission Exhibit No. 203; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. No, sir; I did not&mdash;you see&mdash;all of these shots sounded the same.
If you heard one you would recognize the other shots and these were all the
same. It was a pop that I don't believe I could identify it any other way than
as a firecracker and this particular picture was made at the time the first firecracker
noise was heard by me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you don't think that there could have been any other
shots fired prior to that time that you wouldn't have heard, you were standing
right there and you would have heard them, would you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I'm sure I would have&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You also testified that you were standing perhaps no more than
15 feet away when the President was hit in the head and that you are absolutely
certain that there were no shots fired after the President was hit in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you tell us approximately how many shots there were
between the first and the last shot&mdash;as you well know&mdash;there were supposed to
have been three shots, but how many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, I wouldn't want to say&mdash;I don't want to guess, because
facts are so important on something like this. I am inclined to feel like that
there were not as many as I have heard people say. I think it's of a smaller
denomination, a smaller number, but I cannot&mdash;I can really only vouch for the
two. Now, I know that there was at least one shot in between.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At least one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I would say that&mdash;I know there was one in between. It is
possible there might have been another one&mdash;I don't really know, but two, I can
really account for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that's the first one and the last one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection as to the spacing of these shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. They seemed to be at almost regular intervals and they were
quick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much time do you think elapsed between the first and the
last shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, let's see&mdash;I would have to figure it out on a speed basis
because they were going at approximately 12 to 15 miles per hour downhill and
I would say that all the shots were fired within the space of less than 30 seconds.
That's an estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How far away was the Presidential car when you took the picture
that has been marked Commission Exhibit No. 203&mdash;you must have had
your camera focused?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; it was about 30 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Looking at Commission Exhibit No. 354, we have placed you at
No. 3 on that picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In looking at Commission Exhibit No. 203, does it appear to
you that 203 could have been taken from position 3 on Commission Exhibit No.
354 and only be 30 feet away from the Presidential car at that time&mdash;I'm not
saying it wasn't&mdash;I mean, just what does it look like to you? The question
I'm driving at, of course, is&mdash;I want to know&mdash;did you move from the time you
took the first picture, which is Commission Exhibit No. 203, and the time you
saw the President's head hit, did you move down the street at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. May I ask you a question in return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I have no reason to doubt that by relating other testimony, that
you have come up with this figure 1 as being an exact location as to when the
Presidential car was struck by the bullet&mdash;the first bullet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean on Commission Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oh, no; not at all. These figures numbers 1, 2, and 3 don't
indicate where the shots hit. They are for entirely different purposes. Figure
No. 1 on this picture, Commission Exhibit No. 354, indicates where someone was
standing&mdash;that's all that indicates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, I will have to ask you this question, then, sir, because as
you will know by looking at this <span class="locked">picture&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 203?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Excuse me&mdash;picture 203&mdash;there is a tree way behind the Presidential
car. Now, figure 1 is placed up in front of this tree, which means that
figure 1 would have been behind the car at the time the President received the
first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; referring to Exhibit No. 354.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of course, that has no significance because these numbers have
nothing to do with the place where the car was when the President was hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I'm sorry&mdash;I just misinterpreted it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I can see why you could assume that, because as you look here
at Commission Exhibit No. 354, you see 1, 2, 3, and 4 spaced down Elm Street
and you did infer that that's the location the President's car was when it was hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which is not right because those numbers do not indicate that
in any way whatsoever&mdash;they are not related to that notion at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; I did not move from fixed position 3. If I moved at
all, it would be to step into the curb area to make a picture and back upon the
curb because there were motorcycle policemen on either side of the Presidential
car and I didn't want to get in their way, but if you will look at this <span class="locked">picture&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Referring to Exhibit No. 203.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. You will see by then referring to picture No. 354, that the
Presidential car was well down Elm Street in front of a tree that is located in
a grassy area which is just off of Elm Street and just off of the street that runs
down in front of the Book Depository Building, which would indicate that the
point at which he was struck, the location of the car, would be approximately
30 feet in front of the position from which I made this picture. Does that make
sense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; what you are saying is that picture 203 was taken at a
time when the President's car had actually gone down Elm Street to a point
past this tree that stands at the corner here, in the grassy area, outlined by Elm
Street and a little street that runs down by the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, the thing that is troubling me, though, Mr. Altgens, is
that you say the car was 30 feet away at the time you took Commission Exhibit
No. 203 and that is the time at which the first shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that it was 15 feet away at the time the third shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But during that period of time the car moved much more than
15 feet down Elm Street going down toward the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't know how many feet it moved, but it moved quite a ways
from the time the first shot was fired until the time the third shot was fired. I'm
having trouble on this Exhibit No. 203 understanding how you could have been
within 30 feet of the President's car when you took Commission Exhibit No. 203
and within 15 feet of the car when he was hit with the last shot in the head without
having moved yourself. Now, you have previously indicated that you were
right beside the President's car when he was hit in the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, I was about 15 feet from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But it was almost directly in front of you as it went down the
street; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Am I wrong, or isn't it correct that under that testimony the
car couldn't have moved very far down Elm Street between the time you took
Exhibit No. 203, which you took when the first shot was fired, and the time
that you saw his head being hit, which was the time the last shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, I have to take into consideration the law governing photographic
materials and the use of optics in cameras&mdash;lenses&mdash;and while my
camera may have been set on a distance of 30 feet, there is a plus or minus
area in which the focus still is maintained. I figure that this is approximately
30 feet because that's what I have measured on my camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you say Exhibit No. 203 was taken about 30 feet away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. But it might be 40 feet, but I couldn't say that that's exactly
the distance because while it may be in focus at 40 feet, my camera has it in
focus 30 feet. It's the same thing&mdash;if I focus at 16 feet, my focus might extend
20 feet and it might also be reduced to 10 feet, but my focusing was in that
general area of 30 feet. I believe, if you will let me say something further
here about this <span class="locked">picture&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Possibly I could step this off myself from this position, this approximate
position where I was standing and step off the distance, using as a
guidepost the marker on this post here or some marker that I can find in the
area and I can probably step it off or measure it off and get the exact footage.
I was just going by the markings on my camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The important thing is&mdash;it's not all that important as to how
far you were away from the car at the time you took the picture&mdash;the thing that
I want to establish is that you are absolutely sure that you took Exhibit No. 203
at about the time the first shot was fired and that you are quite sure also in
your own mind that there were no shots fired after you saw the President hit
in the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. That is correct; in both cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, it is clear from your testimony that the third shot&mdash;the
last shot, rather&mdash;hit the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, off and on we have been referring to the third shot and
the fourth shot, but actually, it was the last shot, the shot did strike the President
and there was no other sound like a shot that was made after that. I was
just going to make a conclusion here, but that's not my place to do that, so I'll
just forget it&mdash;what I was going to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, what were you going to suggest&mdash;go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, it seems obvious now, when you think back on it&mdash;of
course, at the time you don't reason these things out in a state of shock, but it
seemed obvious to me afterwards that there wouldn't be another shot if the
sniper saw what damage he did. He did enough damage to create enough attention
to the fact that everybody knew he was firing a gun. Another shot
would have truly given him away, because everybody was looking for him, but
as I say, that's an obvious conclusion on my part, but there was not another
shot fired after the President was struck in the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, of course, you are aware of the fact that there is an individual
portrayed in Exhibit No. 203, standing right in the door of the School
Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just to the right of the No. A in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are aware that he has been thought to resemble Lee Harvey
Oswald by certain people and it has been my understanding that a newspaper
reporter by the name of Bonafede called you and discussed this picture with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any information as to whether or not that man
might be Lee Oswald or some other man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. No, sir; I have never seen the man before in my life and have
seen no one that looks like him since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did this newspaper reporter tell you that it was Oswald, or
that it was somebody else&mdash;did you have any conversations with him about that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Oh, yes, sir; as a matter of fact I had two calls from him. I
never met the man Bonafede, personally, but I had two calls from him and he
indicated to me he was writing a story around this picture which showed this
controversial figure standing in the doorway of picture No. 203. He was asking
me if I knew him, if I had any information that I might be able to give him in
connection with this, inasmuch as he was doing a story on it, and naturally I
had no information to give him in that connection, but I don't know the man
and I have never had an assignment down at the bookstore before or after the
shooting so I have had no occasion to meet anyone down there in the building
either before or after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think I have any more questions at this point, Mr. Altgens.
Can you think of anything else you think might be significant&mdash;let me ask
you this&mdash;while you were standing there alongside of Elm Street and you heard
this noise that you later deduced was a shot, after that time did you have any
occasion to look up at the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anything up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, as I said earlier&mdash;when I crossed the street, my vision prior
to that was sort of obstructed because of the growth of trees in that area and me
being down in a low spot, I couldn't see the whole building too well, but after
crossing the street, I looked up to that building as well as the other buildings
back on Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; I remember you testified about that and you said you saw
those two Negroes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. I saw the two Negroes but I at that time lent no significance to
that until I later heard where the shots were coming from and also since that
time I have heard other people say they saw them too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know which window they were in, approximately, where
on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, they looked to me to be on the floor below, but they were
leaning out as though they were looking for something. I do remember that,
but since they had nothing in their hands I didn't feel that the shot was coming
from their particular area. I saw no rifle at any time although I was looking
for one and I reported it to my Associated Press that the President was apparently
shot by a high-powered rifle, that's the way we carried it on the wire&mdash;credited
to my statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you saw these Negroes up there, were they in the center
of the building or toward the part of the building closer to the triple underpass
or toward Houston Street, or just where were they on the face here of the
School Book Depository Building as it faces out on Elm Street? And Main
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, as I recall, they were down here close to Houston Street.
They weren't directly under the window that was later described as being the
area of the assassin's nest, but I think they were in a pair of windows that was
maybe the next set of windows over, which was a floor below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say "over," you mean down towards the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that they were closer to the corner of the building that is
near the intersection of Elm and Houston than they were towards the triple
underpass end of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes; there were also a number of people looking out of&mdash;I
believe this building here [indicating on photograph].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Indicating the building immediately across Houston Street from
the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. But&mdash;they were scattered and once again, I couldn't see anything
over there that suggested to me that they might have a rifle, and, of course, the
buildings here which are the county records and courthouse buildings&mdash;those
windows&mdash;I think had nobody in them because I believe they are closed and
locked. I'm not real certain of that, but I don't recall seeing anyone at those
windows over there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you indicate then the building that it catercornered across
the street on Houston Street toward Main Street from the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right at the intersection of Houston Street and Elm as it comes
down and goes past the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At any time after you went back up here and to the intersection
on Elm and Houston and after the motorcade came, did you have occasion to look
down toward the railroad tracks going across the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anybody down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; as a matter of fact&mdash;let me go back to my position at
Houston and Main. I was at that intersection approximately at 11:30, which
meant I had close to an hour wait before the caravan was due in that area,
and along about noon&mdash;of course, there were some other things that happened&mdash;there
was a man who had an epileptic fit along about that area there, a young
fellow approximately 19 or 20 years old, and I was standing over here at the
intersection next to a sergeant's motorcycle&mdash;it was a tricycle motorcycle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was the intersection of Main and Houston that you were
standing near?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; and the time was approximately 12:15, I would imagine&mdash;I
say 12:15 and as I relate the events you will see why I say that, because
this sergeant at the motorcycle called for an ambulance and an ambulance came
and picked the man up and as the ambulance was leaving through the triple
overpass, underneath the triple overpass, I saw the Presidential caravan, the red
lights and so on that lead the caravan, coming on to Main Street off of Harwood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Further up Main Street from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes; clear up at the other end of town because Main Street goes
uphill and that made it easy for me to spot the red lights indicating the Presidential
caravan then was starting down Main Street, and along about the time
the sergeant called for the ambulance, I was looking back up here at the triple
overpass and I remarked to the sergeant, I said, "Look at all those people up
there on the triple overpass." I would estimate about a dozen were up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On the railroad tracks immediately over Elm&mdash;immediately over
the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; and I said, "I wonder what the heck all those people
are doing up there when they wouldn't let me up there to make pictures?" And
he said, "Well, I suppose they are railroad people." I said, "Well, if they are
permitted up there, it seems like they would let me up there just to make a picture."
He said, "Well, you know we've got our orders too." So, I just dropped
it at that time, but there were at that time&mdash;now, this was prior to the Presidential
arrival in the Main-Houston Street area that I noticed these people up
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Up on the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes; I keep forgetting that we are taking the testimony down
here. After the Presidential caravan had proceeded down Elm Street, this was
approximately 12:25, then, after the President was shot&mdash;the car passed in front
of me&mdash;I stepped into the curb area and made a picture of the Secret Service man
going to the assistance of Mrs. Kennedy. I made a picture at that time which
shows part of the triple overpass but it does not show the people up on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you notice whether there were still people on it at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Yes, sir; there were people up on it and I looked in that direction,
but not for a firearm&mdash;I didn't really expect any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Because as I said before&mdash;the way the bullet impact hit the
President, it had to come from behind or beside the automobile in order to cause
him to move forward a little bit and I didn't expect to find anything up in that
area, so that is why I was concentrating my observation back in this part, back
in the Main&mdash;excuse me&mdash;back in the Houston-Elm intersection area to see if I
could find the rifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't see anybody standing on the overpass with a firearm
of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think I have any more questions, Mr. Altgens, unless you
can think of something else that you think would be significant that I haven't
thought to ask you about, I think we can terminate the deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. No, sir; I can't think of anything&mdash;it seems like we have covered
it pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you very much for coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. You are welcome, sir&mdash;I was glad to do it and I hope that whatever
I've had to say will be of some help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think it will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Let me tell you this off the record, because it doesn't matter,
but you notice Mr. Switzer, the FBI agent that came out&mdash;he and his partner&mdash;and
talked with me, he brought up this Bonafede to me&mdash;the name and then he
asked me if I knew somebody else, a woman columnist in a Chicago newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. And then showed me a clipping where she too had referred to
me in the taking of a picture and I also received a telephone call from a John
Gold who is, I guess, a correspondent connected with the London Daily News.
I got a call from him on the Thursday night about 11 or 11:30 at night, asking me
what that story was all about <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Magy Daley story or the Bonafede story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. No; this was the Bonafede story, because they had put it on
television&mdash;as a teaser to sell publications and the public on the upcoming
Sunday&mdash;the Sunday publication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; the New York Tribune.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. And gee, I didn't know what to tell the guy because I didn't
know Bonafede had written, but Bonafede talked with me. I asked him and
I said, "Are you going to quote me on anything I say?" And, he says, "Well, if
I do quote you, I'll call you back and ask you for your permission," and I said,
Swell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of course, he did quote you and he didn't call you back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, I got a copy of the thing&mdash;I didn't gather from the article
he was quoting me on anything in particular other than to say that I was a
witness and I hadn't been called to testify before the Commission or questioned
by the FBI or the Secret Service, but I don't think that he really tied any information
to me in the course of writing the story, but it was real strange the
way the thing unfolded. I had tried previously to get my bureau chief to give
me permission to notify the Warren Commission or someone to let them know
I had been in the area, not that my testimony would be of much value, but still
if it could be of just a little bit of help I wanted to do what I thought was right,
and my boss never got permission for me to do that, and that's why I never did
step forward, because I had no authority. Really, I didn't feel that I could act
on my own. I wanted to wait until someone gave me authority to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, your testimony has been helpful to the extent that it helps
to establish the timing of the shots and I'm glad you gave it to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Altgens</span>. Well, I wish I had been able to give this information to you the
next day when it was fresh on my mind because 6 months or so later, sometimes
the facts might be just a little bit off and I hate to see it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All right. Thank you very much for coming.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t525">TESTIMONY OF HARRY D. HOLMES</h2>

<p>The testimony of Harry D. Holmes was taken at 2 p.m., on July 23, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you rise and raise your right hand? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you have previously been examined by one
of the attorneys on the staff, and I assume they advised you of the basis on
which we are conducting the examination and the rights that you have in the
situation, so I won't bother to go through that again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Harry D. Holmes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are the chief postal inspector?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; it is just postal inspector.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Stationed with the post office here in Dallas; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I just have a few questions that I wanted to ask you that have
come up since we took your testimony the last time. One of the things I would
like to know about, if you have any information on it, is how long it ordinarily
takes a parcel post shipment to come to Dallas from Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It would depend on the time of day it was mailed, and whether
it was mailed just prior to the next most expeditious dispatch. But I would say
certainly not over, well, it would be in Dallas the next day. But whether it
would get to a box&mdash;that's right, it would be available at his box&mdash;should be
the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of course, this question relates specifically to the shipment of
the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Shipped from Chicago and addressed to Mr. Hidell at Post Office
Box 2915 here in Dallas, and you say that it generally would have been available
at the post office here in Dallas the day following its delivery to the post
office in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I have no idea when it was mailed there, but it should have
been available here the next day. If it were to be delivered to a street address,
it would be the second day, because it would not make morning delivery. But
to a post office box, he should have. Of course, he had told me he didn't come
to that box too regularly, so there is no assurance of when it was picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But as far as the possibility is concerned, it would have been
available here at the post office box the following morning from Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After it has been received here in Dallas, as I understand the
procedure, a notice would be put in the post office box indicating that a package
was being held there in the post office; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. There is a regular card, when the package is too large to go in
the box, or if it is c.o.d., or insured, or registered. However, this was an ordinary
parcel. It was not insured or c.o.d. There would be a card for him put in the box,
and he would have to pick it up at a window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about as far as Los Angeles is concerned, from Los
Angeles to Dallas? How long would it take a parcel post to reach Dallas from
Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. At least 2 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could it possibly be longer than 2 days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much longer, do you think? How about on the average, do
you have any idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; it depends on the time of mailing. It is 2 days' train run
from Los Angeles here, and if it happens to catch an early dispatch, it would be
in here the morning of the third day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From Chicago it is only a 1-day train run, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So it would be here, if it had an early dispatch, on the morning
of the following day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My understanding is that an application for a post office box
comes in three separate parts. Do you <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(Mr. Holmes hands paper to attorney.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have, in fact, handed me a sample of such an application.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I thought you might want one, so I brought one along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was very good, and we will mark this as Holmes Exhibit
No. 1-A on your deposition of July 23, 1964. I have put my initials on the corner
after I have marked it. Would you initial it, too, for the purpose of identification?</p>

<p>(Mr. Holmes initials.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the ordinary procedure that is followed when a box
is rented and this form is used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. The form is completed, usually by the applicant, and it must be
signed by the applicant, even if an employee does complete it. This portion of
the&mdash;I don't know how you want to designate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We will number them portions 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. All right, part 1 of this application is simply the instructions on
a combination box, and instructions to the patron is torn off, and he keeps it or
they throw it away. Portions 2 and 3 are completed, too. 2 gives the applicant's
name, the name of his corporation or firm he represents, if applicable, the kind
of business, the business address, the home address, and the place for his signature
and the date. On the third portion is a box for him to indicate whether
he wants all mail in the box, or just whether he wants some other disposition
and so on, and a place for name of person entitled to receive mail through the
box other than the applicant himself, and he fills in that. These two portions
then remain together in the file of the post office where he made application.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is portions 2 and 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Until he relinquishes the box. They pull this out and endorse it
so the box has been closed, and the date and they tear off 3 and throw it away.
It has no more purpose. That is what happened on box 2915.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They have thrown part 3 away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; as it so happens, even though they closed the box in New
Orleans, they still had part 3 and it showed that the mail for Marina Oswald
and A.&nbsp;J. Hidell was good in the box. They hadn't complied with regulations.
They still had it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was a lucky thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. We wish they had here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now is this regulation that says section 3 should be torn off
and thrown away, is that a general regulation of the Post Office Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It is in the Post Office Manual Instructions to employees; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So there is no way, as I understand it, to tell from the records
maintained, as far as you know anyway, who was authorized to receive mail at
Post Office Box 2915 that Oswald had while he was here in Dallas before he
went to New Orleans in April of 1963; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Other than Oswald himself and his name on the application.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Now he did tell me in personal interrogation that no one was
permitted to get mail in that box but him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He said that same thing about the box in New Orleans, too,
didn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. He did at first, and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then you showed him portion three of the application and then
he changed his story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I said how about Marina Oswald, and he said, well, she was my
wife. What is wrong with that? And I said how about A.&nbsp;J. Hidell, and he
said I don't know anything about that. And I said look here. And he said,
well, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now supposing that Oswald had not in fact authorized A.&nbsp;J.
Hidell to receive mail here in the Dallas box and that a package came addressed
to the name of Hidell, which, in fact, one did at Post Office Box 2915, what procedure
would be followed when that package came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. They would put the notice in the box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Regardless of whose name was associated with the box?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is the general practice. The theory being, I have a box.
I have a brother come to visit me. My brother would have my same name&mdash;well,
a cousin. You can get mail in there. They are not too strict. You don't
have to file that third portion to get service for other people there. I imagine
they might have questioned him a little bit when they handed it out to him, but
I don't know. It depends on how good he is at answering questions, and everything
would be all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that the package would have come in addressed to Hidell at
Post Office Box 2915, and a notice would have been put in the post office box
without regard to who was authorized to receive mail from it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Actually, the window where you get the box is all the way
around the corner and a different place from the box, and the people that box
the mail, and in theory&mdash;I am surmising now, because nobody knows. I have
questioned everybody, and they have no recollection. The man would take this
card out. There is nothing on this card. There is no name on it, not even a
box number on it. He comes around and says, "I got this out of my box."
And he says, "What box?" "Box number so and so." They look in a bin where
they have this by box numbers, and whatever the name on it, whatever they
gave him, he just hands him the package, and that is all there is to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Ordinarily, they won't even request any identification because
they would assume if he got the notice out of the box, he was entitled to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is very possible that that in fact is what happened in this
case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is in theory. I would assume that is what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On the other hand, it is also possible that Oswald had actually
authorized Hidell to receive mail through the box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Could have been. And on the other hand, he had this identification
card of Hidell's in his billfold, which he could have produced and showed
the window clerk. Either way, he got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right. I believe I am correct in my understanding that when
Mr. Belin took your testimony previously, that you did mark as exhibits the
various forms that Oswald had filled out here in the Post Office Department in
Dallas; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. You mean the box rent application?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I have long since given them to the FBI. However, I endorsed
them at the time I gave them to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I can't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I will show you a photocopy maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The basic thrust of my question is that you have given the
originals of the documents to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I have the receipts, except for Ruby's box, which nobody ever
asked me for, and I still have them. That is Ruby's box at the Terminal Annex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, that is not a part of the record so far. We should mark it
as a part of the record now. Are you required to keep this in your records?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. If you will give me a receipt for it. I have a photocopy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is quite as legible, the photocopy, so why don't I just mark
the photocopy and you keep the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have initialed the photocopy, and I would like to have you
initial it also for the purpose of identification, and we will mark that as Holmes
Exhibit No. 2-A on your deposition of July 23, 1064, a photocopy of a post office
box application in the name of Jack Ruby, dated November 1, 1963. Post Office
Box No. 5475, and as I understand it, this was an application that was made at
the Terminal Annex here in Dallas, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there any way in which we can tell from just looking at it,
or that is something you know from having gotten the copy from the Terminal
Annex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. The box number categories are set out for each station that
comes within that bracket. The applications don't tell you what post office it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
from. It might be from San Antonio. But I don't know why. What are your
initials and name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. W.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;L., Wesley J. Liebeler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. How do you spell your last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span> (spelling). L-i-e-b-e-l-e-r.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Thank you [handing another card to Mr. Liebeler]. I will explain
it to you, and you might want to ask me for the record what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; you have handed me a postcard, Post Office Department
Form 3546, Notice to Change Forwarding Order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is different from our 3575 in that this is simply a forwarding
order. This is to change a forwarding order. To interpret it, Lee Oswald,
on October 11, 1963, in New Orleans, gave his box 2915 in Dallas as the last
address. He had given a forwarding order on this box to this box 30061 in New
Orleans on May 14, 1963. Now then, he is again forwarding from this box. Not
again, but it is a second forwarding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This would indicate that instructions had been given to forward
from box 2915 here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Direct without going <span class="locked">through&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This would indicate that all together, he had first issued instructions
that mail should be forwarded from box 2915 in Dallas to box 30061 in New
Orleans, and this would now indicate that mail was to be forwarded to 2515
West Fifth Street in Irving, Tex., and that is dated October 11, 1963. Now,
there are several postmarks appearing on this form. There is one Dallas postmark
of October 16 on both sides, and there is also a postmark in New Orleans,
which is difficult to read, but it is sometime in October. Now you suggested perhaps
October 11, 1963. What do you interpret happened with regard to this
notice, Post Office Department Form 3546? Can you tell from looking at it where,
in the ordinary course of events, he would have first prepared this form?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That would have been prepared in New Orleans and dropped
in the mailbox. He would have prepared that at a station, because they have
filled the front in and crossed it out. In fact, they hand these out at the stations.
He has gone into the station probably where he had this box. In the normal
course of the patron's activities he would have gone into that station where that
box is and said, "I want my mail forwarded." All right, fill this out.</p>

<p>It looks like they might have filled it out for him. It doesn't look too much
like his writing. But they would have filled this out to show that mail from
this box should not be sent to New Orleans, but sent to Irving, so the post office
would send that up to Dallas where this box is at the main office, and they would
have that on file here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Box 2915, you mean? That address here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Here is a photocopy of box 2915 application, and it will show it
was closed on May 14, 1963, which is this red figure up here. So when they got
that in here in Dallas, they would have put this red mark on there for some reason
to show when the box was closed, and then they would keep this in their file
as instructions until they got some other instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Isn't it possible that this form which, well, do you have a photostatic
of this form we have been talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me mark this original one for the record then, if I may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have initialed this Post Office Department Form 3546, which
has been marked "Holmes Exhibit No. 3-A on deposition of July 23, 1964," and I
would like to have you initial it also for the purpose of identification.</p>

<p>(Mr. Holmes initials.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to ask you some more questions about Holmes Exhibit
No. 3, which is postmarked, as we have indicated, October 16, in Dallas, and also
bears a postmark in New Orleans which I think is October 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. My best educated guess is the 11th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me come bluntly to the point. My problem is this. Oswald
wasn't in New Orleans on October 11. He was in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Now, he could have filled that out here. It could have been
mailed to New Orleans for forwarding the mail up from there. He could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
mailed it from some other post office, and they would have mailed it. But they
would have had to enclose it in an envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; because it is addressed to the postmaster in Dallas, Tex.,
and just as sure as anything it has a New Orleans postmark on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; prior to the Dallas one, if we read the New Orleans one
correctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The New Orleans is hard to read, but it certainly is an October
postmark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is the reason I wanted you to read the memo, because the
hours are down there and are different from that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now the New Orleans Post Office inspector, or an inspector in
the office of New Orleans, has advised you that Oswald filled out a form 3575?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is the regular forwarding order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he did that on September 24; is that correct? Or September
25?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. September 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. September 24, 1963, and his box down there was closed on
September 26, presumably pursuant to the order that was mailed to them under
postmark of September 24, 1963. Now has the Post Office Department in New Orleans
given you any advice at all, as far as you can tell, concerning this Post
Office Department Form 3546, which we have marked Holmes Exhibit No. 3-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; other than their postmark on there. There is no endorsement
there. But you see, Lafayette Station is in New Orleans, and it looks like
that was completed by the person at Lafayette Station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Inasmuch as that is exactly what it says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. If that were completed in some other post office, they wouldn't
know that box was in Lafayette Station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me suggest this. There is not the slightest evidence that
Oswald ever filled that form out or ever saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. No; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because it is perfectly obvious this isn't his handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. That is my opinion, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So apparently somebody in the New Orleans Post Office filled
this form out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. They could have done it over a telephone instruction, long-distance
telephone call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, they could have done that from the records they had in
their possession, because he already had filled out a Post Office Department 3575
instructing to forward mail from Post Office Box 30061 to 2515 West Fifth
Street in Irving, which they had received, of course, on September 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, in any event, we will add this to the pile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. It is an original card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let the record show Mr. Holmes has delivered to us the original
card which has been marked as Holmes Exhibit No. 1-A.</p>

<p>I don't think I have any other questions. I have cleared up the basic problems
we had. Of course, you managed to raise a few more, and I appreciate
that. Thank you very much. As I understand it at this point, Mr. Holmes,
you have given to us or to the FBI, all of the papers that you found so far in
your files relating to Lee Harvey Oswald, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes; you have every original document or item that I have come
in contact with in this business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Between us and the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now it may be as you <span class="locked">suggested&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. Except Ruby's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you have given us a copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I have given you a good clear photocopy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right. If you do come across any other papers in your <span class="locked">files&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>. I will get in touch with Martha Jo [Stroud, assistant U.S. attorney
in Dallas, Tex.].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; let us know. Thank you a lot again.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Frazier. I believe you have already appeared before the
Commission itself and given testimony of your knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you please stand and take the oath. Do you solemnly swear

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to ask you two or three questions that were not asked
you when you appeared before the Commission. Your name is Buell Wesley
Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are the same Buell Wesley Frazier, as I understand, who
has previously testified before the Commission about Lee Harvey Oswald and
about how Oswald rode back and forth with you from Irving to Dallas; isn't
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think he came with you to work on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You testified in Washington that on that particular morning
you saw Oswald carrying a large brown package from the car into the Texas
School Book Depository Building and that also you saw that package in the
car; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you described that package and you told us about what
you saw in detail at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Oswald with the package similar to the one
you saw on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see Oswald carry a package from Irving into the
Texas School Book Depository Building that looked anything like the package
he had on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see him with a package that looked like that
package any other time or at any other place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's all the questions I have. Thank you very much for
coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Please sit down. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am an
attorney on the staff of the President's Commission on the Assassination of
President Kennedy. I have been authorized to take your testimony by the Commission,
pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order No. 11130 dated
November 29, 1963, and joint resolution of Congress No. 137. Under the rules
of procedure, you are entitled to have an attorney present, and you are entitled
to 3 days' notice of your hearing. I know you didn't get that, because I just
called you this morning, but I assume that since you are here, you are prepared
to go ahead without an attorney, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Joe Marshall Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. 12015 Androck. That is in Mesquite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. May 1, 1932.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Kleburg, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you outline briefly for us your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir. I went to grade school in Seagoville up to the second
grade. Then I went to Houston, Tex., and finished elementary school there,
and then to junior high school, and through high school in Houston, Tex. Then
I went into the U.S. Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are presently a uniformed officer of the Dallas Police
Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Oh, nearly 8 years, in September it will be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During that time, you have been working basically as a uniformed
officer, patrolman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you been working in any specific type of assignment, or
just what has been the nature of your work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, I was in radio patrol 3½ years. Then I went to traffic
division point control, and that is what I am doing presently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you were assigned to work in the vicinity
of Elm and Houston on November 22, 1963, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us when you first got that assignment and
what you were told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. At approximately 8:45 or 9 o'clock that morning, November 22,
we made detail, and Capt. P.&nbsp;W. Lawrence gave us the instructions that we
were to, of course, hold the traffic up when the motorcade came through, and
to assist in the crowd control, and be specifically on the lookout for anyone
throwing anything from the crowd. That is about all I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many officers were with you as you were instructed at
the detail at 8:45? That means, there was a formation of something in the
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. There was quite a few there. I don't know how many were there,
but nearly the whole traffic department was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they all receive instructions from Captain Lawrence at the
same time, or were they different specific instructions broken down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. There were some broken down instructions that some of the men
had to stay over to get different detail aimed to them, but that was my
instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you receive those instructions in writing, or delivered orally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Delivered orally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In other words, the captain or someone working with the captain
would have a list and he assigned certain men to certain places and gave them
general instructions as to what they were to do; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Men from the department were assigned all along the motorcade
route from the airport into downtown Dallas; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And other men were given instructions similar to or the same
as the ones that you were given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which was to keep traffic out of the way when the motorcade
was coming, and keep an open and clear route, and to engage in general crowd
control activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were there any instructions given to you men about scanning
buildings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Sir, I don't remember. It is more or less the general thing to do.
I mean, just police the area. But I don't remember any specific instructions
on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now after you received your instructions at 8:45, what did
you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I proceeded to the intersection of Elm and Houston, and it was
about 9:50 or 10 o'clock when I was on the corner there. At approximately
11:50 or 12 o'clock, there was a white male that had an epileptic seizure
on the esplanade on Houston Street between Main and Elm. Well, I went down
to see if any assistance was needed, and I stayed there until the white male was
loaded into an ambulance and sent to a hospital. Then I proceeded back to
my assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were there any other officers there in connection with this
fellow that had the epileptic fit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; there was one more. He was a radio patrolman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I don't remember his name. I swear, I was trying to think of it
before this even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was a radio patrolman? You mean he was driving a motorcycle
or had a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; he was assigned, I think, if I am not mistaken, I think he was
assigned to Main and Houston, and he was down there with the man when I
arrived at the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you called an ambulance, or an ambulance was called and
this man was taken away, and you went back to the corner of Elm and Houston
Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many officers were assigned at Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Three of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who were the other two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. W.&nbsp;E. Barnett, and E.&nbsp;L. Smith. I think that is his initials. I
know it is another Smith boy anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you station yourself when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Just after we got the epileptic seizure en route to the hospital, I
hadn't gotten back to the corner but just a few minutes until the motorcade was
coming, so I stationed myself on Elm Street in the middle from the southeast
curb of Elm and Houston and held traffic up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which direction would this traffic have been coming from that
you held up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It was heading west on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Coming down Elm toward the triple underpass? Coming into
the intersection of Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you were the individual patrolman who went back and held
up the traffic to Elm Street; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you would have been on the eastern side of Houston Street
on Elm Street holding up the traffic that was coming down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From that position, could you have observed the windows on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
the side of the Texas School Book Depository Building room which the shots
were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; I could see some of the windows. I couldn't see them
all, but I was pretty busy getting traffic held up, and I must admit I had my back
to the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because you were facing traffic that was coming down Elm
Street toward the triple underpass toward the intersection of Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you had no opportunity to scan the windows of the Texas
School Book Depository Building at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you did not scan the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now did you notice anything extraordinary in the crowd
as far as a crowd control is concerned? Did you have any problems in that
connection, or was it just a matter of holding up the traffic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; we didn't have any trouble with the crowd at that particular
intersection. They stayed back pretty well as they were told, and I
got all the cars stopped, so I thought we had it made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you a picture, an aerial view of the area that is marked
Commission Exhibit No. 354. Could you locate the Texas School Book Depository
Building in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; it should be right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; that is it on the left-hand side of the picture, and of
course, the intersection of Elm and Houston is right off opposite the corner
there, right at the corner of the Texas School Book Depository Building, and
you were standing to the east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Right along in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is, in fact, a picture of a car stopped there right at the
intersection of Elm and Houston, and you had been standing back in the
vicinity of the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Just about the middle of Elm Street here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I will put the No. 4 in a circle on the spot of approximately
where you were standing at the time the motorcade went by. Is that approximately
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were facing east up Elm Street away from the triple
underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that your back was in fact turned to the School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now there are two or three other buildings here in the immediate
vicinity as you are facing east on Elm Street. There is a building
on your left, which is directly across Houston Street from the School Book
Depository Building. Do you know what building that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I know, but I can't remember now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you observe any activity in any of the windows of that
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have occasion to look to the windows of that building
at any time when the motorcade came by? That would be the building to your
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir. I don't recall, but I know that I must have, because
I was trying to keep all the crowd in sight that was around. I know that I
must have glanced at it, but I don't recall seeing anything unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about the building across Elm Street on your right?
That is the county building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There are a series of windows in that building facing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
triple underpass. Could you observe those windows from the point where you
were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; not where I could tell whether they were open or closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because you were standing too far up Elm Street to have a
good vantage point from which to observe these windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I mean on Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is what I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You wouldn't have been able to see the windows of the building
that is down on the intersection of Main and Houston Streets at all from where
you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you could have seen, it would have been with great difficulty,
so you weren't in position to observe those windows, and you didn't in fact
observe them, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. While you were standing here and the motorcade went by, tell
us what happened at that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you turn to watch the motorcade? Did you turn to watch
the President as the motorcade went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; I glanced around and was watching the crowd to make
sure they stayed back out of the way of the motorcade, and also to make sure
none of the cars started up or anything. Then I heard the shots, and I
immediately proceeded from this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Point 4 on Commission Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I started up toward this Book Depository after I heard the shots,
and I didn't know where the shots came from. I had no idea, because it was
such a ricochet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. An echo effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; and this woman came up to me and she was just in
hysterics. She told me, "They are shooting the President from the bushes." So
I immediately proceeded up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You proceeded up to an area immediately behind the concrete
structure here that is described by Elm Street and the street that runs immediately
in front of the Texas School Book Depository, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I was checking all the bushes and I checked all the cars in the
parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is a parking lot in behind this grassy area back from Elm
Street toward the railroad tracks, and you went down to the parking lot and
looked around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; I checked all the cars. I looked into all the cars and
checked around the bushes. Of course, I wasn't alone. There was some deputy
sheriff with me, and I believe one Secret Service man when I got there.</p>

<p>I got to make this statement, too. I felt awfully silly, but after the shot and
this woman, I pulled my pistol from my holster, and I thought, this is silly, I
don't know who I am looking for, and I put it back. Just as I did, he showed me
that he was a Secret Service agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you accost this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, he saw me coming with my pistol and right away he showed
me who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I don't&mdash;because then we started checking the cars. In
fact, I was checking the bushes, and I went through the cars, and I started over
here in this particular section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Down toward the railroad tracks where they go over the triple
underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any basis for believing where the shots came from,
or where to look for somebody, other than what the lady told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; except that maybe it was a power of suggestion. But it
sounded to me like they may have came from this vicinity here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Down around the&mdash;let's put a No. 5 there at the corner here
behind this concrete structure where the bushes were down toward the railroad
tracks from the Texas School Book Depository Building on the little street that
runs down in front of the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you say that you had the idea that the shots may have
come from up in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; that is just what, well, like I say, the sound of it. That
was the most helpless and hopeless feeling I ever had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, you mentioned before there was an echo from the shots in
the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Probably caused by the fact that there are some large buildings
around the area where the shots were fired from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now did you at any time have occasion to look up to the railroad
tracks that went across the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; I looked up there after I was going up to check there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't have any occasion to look up there before you heard
the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you heard the shots, you proceeded down along the bushes
here between the street that runs in front of the Texas School Book Depository
Building and Elm Street to approximately point 5, and then when you went
down looking to the cars, you then had occasion to look up at the railroad tracks
running over the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anybody up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; there was two other officers there, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were there any other people up there, that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; none that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you remember that there were two police officers up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you searched these cars in this parking lot area down
there by the railroad tracks on from point 5 down toward the main railroad
tracks that cross over the triple underpass. Did you find anything that you
could associate in any way with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you remain down in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Oh, I would say approximately 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During that time, you continued searching through automobiles
and searching the general area in the parking lot back there; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do after you had searched this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, it was, I don't remember whether this was a deputy
sheriff&mdash;I don't know his name&mdash;he was in civilian clothes&mdash;he said they came
from the building up here. And by that time, of course, all the police around
there sealed the building off, and I went to the front door here on the, well, you
might say, the Houston Street side. I and Barnett, and we sealed the front door
and didn't let anyone in or out until he was passed by the chief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me ask you this. Before you went up to the School Book
Depository Building, am I correct in understanding that you did thoroughly
search the area of the parking lot, you and the other officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, now, I didn't go into all the cars. I looked into them, and
I was well satisfied in my mind that he wasn't around there.</p>

<p>Some of the cars were locked, and I just looked into all of them around there,
and I went back to the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who gave you instructions to go to the front door of that building,
do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I believe it was Sergeant Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Sergeant Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Sergeant Howard, or Sergeant Harkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So to the best of your recollection, it was one of those two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir. Wait&mdash;let's strike that. No; it wasn't. It was Chief
Lumpkin give us the direct order, I and Barnett, not to let anyone in or out of
that building; that's right&mdash;Deputy Chief Lumpkin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you see him in order to receive that order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I started back up here to the building, and we were just about at
the front door when he contacted me and Barnett then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He instructed you and Barnett to stand at the front door and
not let anyone in or out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know approximately what time that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; it must have been about 1. It was after 1 o'clock. I
don't remember; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you and Barnett remain there at the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Until about 2:30; I think I got off there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you at any time go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether other men were assigned to watch the
back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I don't know. I am quite certain there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you had no personal knowledge of it at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because you were assigned to the front door, and that is where
you stayed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In fact, did you let anybody in or out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, now, we let police officers in, of course, and firemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The firemen came into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; there was something on that that they had to get some&mdash;what
was that, I don't recall what it was that they come in there for now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There were some firemen from the Dallas Fire Department that
went into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they come back to the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about Secret Service; were there any Secret Service
agents around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I don't know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Agent Sorrels, the agent in charge of the Dallas
office of the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I saw him a few minutes, but I don't know him personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember seeing him around that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you at any time see Lee Harvey Oswald come in or out of
the building, or in the area at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there anything that happened while you were standing there
with Barnett at the front door that you think would be of significance that the
Commission should know about that I haven't asked you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You just maintained the general guard duty there and only let
the police officers and fire department in, and you don't have any specific recollection
as to Secret Service agents. How about FBI agents; were there some of
those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; there were FBI agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You let them go in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any specific FBI agents that were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I don't remember any of the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who finally relieved you from that particular duty post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Let me think here a minute now. Chief Lumpkin, I know&mdash;I don't
recall who the officer was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think it is of any particular importance if you can't
recall. What did you do after you were finally relieved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I don't know if this is of significance either, but they had set up,
the Salvation Army had some coffee and I had a cup of coffee and proceeded
on back to the Mercantile Bank. I had an extra job there that evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were relieved from your duty post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And went on about your own personal affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you conduct any additional investigation or have anything
to do with the investigation of the assassination after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Remotely. I didn't know him real well. Just knew him when
I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you first hear about Oswald's capture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It was after I left my post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you left your post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; in fact, just before I got off from working at the bank. Just
before 6 o'clock. A squad of detectives, I don't recall their names, but they
told me they got a man over at the Texas Theatre that they thought might have
been the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you heard the shots and went from Point 4 on Commission
Exhibit No. 354 down to point 5 searching the bushy area here, did you
have any occasion to look up in the windows of any of the buildings surrounding
the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I was&mdash;pardon the expression&mdash;beating the bushes and
checking the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you never saw anything in any of those windows at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you familiar with the traffic patterns on these three streets
here, Commerce, Main, and Elm Streets, as they go down under the triple
underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The motorcade came down Main Street from the east to the
intersection of Main Street and Houston, did it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; headed west on Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; and it turned right on Houston Street and then turned
left on Elm and was headed toward the triple underpass when the assassination
occurred. What would have prevented the motorcade from going directly down
Main Street under the triple underpass, remembering now that the motorcade
wanted to go onto Stemmons Freeway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I don't know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, could you have gone straight down Main Street and gotten
onto Stemmons Freeway down here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where the three streets go under the triple overpass, there is a
concrete barrier between Elm Street and Main Street; is there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where the streets actually go under the railroad tracks here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now where is the entrance as we go off, as we see the three
streets going off the picture here, Commission Exhibit No. 354? Where is the
entrance to the Stemmons Freeway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It is back off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is not shown on the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; it is back off here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To go down Stemmons Expressway or Freeway towards the
trade mart, you would have to turn how? Would you turn to your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now could you have actually gone off to the right and crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
over Elm Street if you had been on Main Street and gone under the triple
underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. They merge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They all merge together down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So as far as you know, there was no reason why the motorcade
couldn't have gone straight down Elm Street and gone on to the Stemmons
Freeway headed for the trade mart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. As far as I know, there is no reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is it possible that as you come down Main Street, if you stayed
directly on Main Street going under the triple underpass, that you might have
difficulty in making the turn with a big car from Main Street to go onto Stemmons
Freeway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't think I have any more questions about the situation,
unless you can think of something else that you might have seen or observed
that day that I haven't asked you about that you think the Commission should
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Sir, I just can't think of anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to thank you very much for coming over. I appreciate
your cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir; thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t539">TESTIMONY OF WELCOME EUGENE BARNETT</h2>

<p>The testimony of Welcome Eugene Barnett was taken at 3:50 p.m., on July 23,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before you sit down, will you raise your right hand? Do you
solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Please sit down. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am an
attorney for the President's Commission investigating the assassination of
President Kennedy. I have been authorized to take your testimony by the
Commission, pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order 11130
dated November 29, 1963, and joint resolution of Congress No. 137. Pursuant to
the rules of the Commission governing the taking of testimony, you are entitled
to have an attorney present if you want one, and you are entitled to 3 days' notice
of the hearing. I know you did not get the 3 days' notice because of schedule
difficulties that we had, and you were just advised of it this morning, I believe.
I assume, however, that since you are here, that you are prepared to go ahead
with your testimony without having an attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Welcome Eugene Barnett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When and where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. July 12, 1932, New Hope, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are apparently a uniformed officer of the Dallas Police
Department, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been in the Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Eight and a half years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is my understanding that you were assigned to the area of
Elm and Houston Streets on November 22, 1963; is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us how you received instructions to go there,
when you received them, what you were told, and what happened? Would
you tell us what happened on that day, in other words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. We made detail around 9 o'clock. We were instructed to be at
our assignments at 10. We were given our assignments, each one was given
an assignment, and I was told to watch the crowd, watch for people throwing
stuff from the crowd at the President's party, to keep the traffic clear, and to
stop the traffic when the President came by. Then when the President came
by, I heard three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, going back, you got to the area around 10 o'clock; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you go when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Well, there were three of us assigned to that one corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who were the other officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Who were the other officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. J.&nbsp;D. Smith, and another officer named Smith. I don't know his
initials. E.&nbsp;L., I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you divide your duties among yourselves when you got there,
or had you been specifically instructed as to what each one was supposed to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. We divided our duties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Well, as best I remember, we each picked a corner and got on
the corner. We were advised to stay on our corner, not to cross over to idly
talk, but to stay on the corner and keep our eyes open and be ready.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which corner did you station yourself at? I have a picture here
of an aerial view&mdash;you can sit down&mdash;Commission Exhibit No. 354.</p>

<p>Of course, you can recognize the intersection of Elm and Houston here in the
left-hand upper portion of the picture; can you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I was right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you remain there at all times from 10 o'clock until the motorcade
arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes; well, of course, I was here until we got word to stop the
traffic, and I stepped out of this position here. I had to stop traffic from Houston
here and help the other officers stop it on Elm, and stop this traffic on this small
street that goes in front of the Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When the motorcade actually came, you moved over pretty much
into Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To stop the traffic that was coming?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. South on Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. South on Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir; Elm Street is so wide, and I helped these officers here
stop this traffic here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have written the No. 4 on here before and it is kind of hard
to read. You also helped to stop the traffic that was coming down here in the
area of No. 4, which would have been the traffic on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir; I was standing right about this position right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Right about No. 8?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now specifically, were you given any instructions when you left
that morning when you made detail, to observe and scan the windows of the
buildings around that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No, sir; we weren't, but that is just one thing you always do. It
is understood that you have the buildings to watch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But there were no specific instructions given to any of the officers,
so far as you know, when they left that morning, about watching the windows in
the area?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I don't see any use in being instructed on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, regardless of that <span class="locked">fact&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. There was no instructions; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now from where you were standing at position 1 prior to the
motorcade's arrival, you were in a position to view the windows on the entire
south side of the Texas School Book Depository Building; were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you look up at those windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many times did you look up at those windows before the
motorcade came? Can you tell us with what frequency?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I looked up twice. Maybe once at 11, probably a few minutes
after 11&mdash;probably a few minutes after 11. It was raining part of the morning,
and when I found out that the people in the building were going to come outside
and watch the President, I looked up at the building, and then I looked at all
the buildings, and there were no windows that I noticed open then. But after
a few minutes before the President came by, I didn't look any more. I started
watching the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So just before the motorcade approached, you moved over and
also stopped the automobile traffic and were observing the crowd, so you did not
look at the windows on or about the time the motorcade came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I couldn't. I was too busy. [Referring to picture.] I got this
in the wrong place. It needs to be about this position right here, instead of
here. I was right here. I got it too far, but I could see the President's car from
the position I was, so I had to be right here [pointing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are satisfied you were further out into the intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Right there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. [Marking]. In the general vicinity of No. 9?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir; the car passed within a few feet of me, and I was holding
some people, or seeing that they stayed back, and one small boy started.
I was afraid he was going to get too close and I stopped him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now the motorcade made the turn onto Elm Street from Houston
Street, and you were standing at approximately in position No. 9, and you indicated
before that you heard the shots fired: is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any echo in the area from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. What do you mean by echo? You mean another sound besides
the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No; I didn't hear any echo. The whole sound echoed. The sound
lingered, but as far as just two definite distinct sounds, when each shot was fired,
that one sound would linger in the air, but there would be nothing else until
the next shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see any of the shots hit the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Well, when the first shot&mdash;I was looking at the President when
the first shot was fired, and I thought I saw him slump down, but I am not sure,
and I didn't look any more then. I thought he was ducking then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now when you were standing up there in position No. 9, you were
in a spot where you could look right down Elm Street and see the railroad tracks
down here which pass over the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anybody on the railroad tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. One or two officers. Two officers, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anybody else, as far as you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. That is all I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have an opinion when you heard the shots as to where
they came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you think about them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. When the first shot was fired, I thought it was a firecracker, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
I looked across the street. In fact, I scanned the whole area to see where people
would jump or move or make some action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You couldn't tell specifically where it had come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Not the first one, but I thought it was a firecracker. But none
of the people moved or took any action, whereas they would have if a firecracker
went off. And when the second shot was fired, it sounded high. The sound
of the second one seemed to me like it was coming from up high, and I looked
up at the building and I saw nothing in the windows. In fact, I couldn't even
see any windows at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No, sir; because I was standing too close, was the reason. And
I looked back again at the crowd, and the third shot was fired. And I looked up
again, and I decided it had to be on top of that building. To me, it is the only
place the sound could be coming from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do when you concluded that the shots were
coming from that building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I ran to the back of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Ran down Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is a door in the back of the Texas School Book Depository.
Does it face on Houston or around the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. It is around the corner from Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No, sir; I didn't get close to it, because I was watching for a
fire escape. If the man was on top, he would have to come down, and I was
looking for a fire escape, and I didn't pay much attention to the door.</p>

<p>I was still watching the top of the building, and so far as I could see, the
fire escape on the east side was the only escape down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Since you surmised that the shots had come from the building,
you looked up and you didn't see any windows open. You thought they had been
fired from the top of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you ran around here on Houston Street immediately to the
east of the Texas School Book Depository Building and watched the fire escape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I went 20 foot past the building still on Houston, looking up.
I could see the whole back of the building and also the east side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anybody coming off the fire escape up there, or any
movement on top of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Not a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do after you went around behind the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I looked behind the building and I saw officers searching the
railroad cars. I looked around in front towards the front of the building and I
saw officers going west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Going west down that little street there in front of the School
Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes; but there was no sign they were going into the building
or watching the building, so I decided I was the only one watching the building.
So since this was the only fire escape and there was officers down here watching
this back door, I returned back around to the front to watch the front of the
building and the fire escape. Then I decided maybe I had been wrong, so I
saw the officers down here searching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean the officers went on down toward No. 5 on our
Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. When I got to the front, some of the officers were coming back
toward me, started back toward me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were still back near the intersection of Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir; I was back where No. 8 is then. That was probably
2½ minutes after the last shot was fired. About that time, my sergeant came
up from this way, from the north of Houston Street and asked me to get the
name of that building. I broke and ran to the front and got the name of it.
There were people going in and out at that time. I ran back and told him the
name of it, and about that time a construction worker ran from this southwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
corner of the intersection up to me and said, "I was standing over there and
saw the man in the window with the rifle." He and I and the sergeant all
three broke and ran for the door. I kept the man there with me. The sergeant
ran to the back to make sure it was covered. I kept the man there until they
took him across the street to the courthouse. I was there until 3 o'clock, at
the door there with one of the other officers, J.&nbsp;D. Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't actually go into the building at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long do you think it was from the time the last shot was
fired until the time you were at the front door keeping people from going in
and out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. It was around 2½ minutes. Maybe between 2½ or 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From the time the last shot was fired until the time you were
standing at that front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you let anybody out of the building after you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No, sir; until they were authorized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was in a position to authorize people to come in and out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Well, of course, for sometime no one left except city, county,
and Federal officers, and then after the people in the building were took into
the small room there and questioned, they were brought to the door by a lieutenant,
which I don't remember his name, but that was sometime after, and he
brought them to the door and told us to let them out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, it was possible that people could have left the building
between the time the last shot was fired and the time you and Officer Smith
stationed yourselves there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. When I went to the door to get the name of the building, there
were people going in and out then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think it was as quickly as 2½ minutes from the time
the last shot was fired until the time you got to the front door? Do you think
it was that quick?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I believe it was 2½ minutes probably from the time I ran from
the back to the front. That was probably 2½ minutes. Then it took me 20 or
30 more seconds before I got to the front there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So your recollection is that it was fairly short order that you
got to the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Three minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now who was the one sergeant who instructed you to post
yourself there at the door, or was it somebody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Sergeant Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You remained there at the door for how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Until 3 o'clock. Close to 11:30 to 3&mdash;close to 12:30 to 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At which time you were relieved from duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir; from that position I had to go back to my regular
assignment at Commerce and Akard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you notice Oswald around that area at anytime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Later on you saw his picture in the paper and, of course, on
television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had no recollection of seeing him in the area at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. None whatsoever. There were hundreds of people in that intersection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever talked to any other officer in the department that
remembers seeing him in the area at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you heard of anybody that saw him there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Well, of course, I heard other officers that went up in the
building and talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Officer Baker was one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. I haven't talked to the officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you were pretty sure fairly quickly that the shots had come
from the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was no notion in your mind that they could have come
from these railroad tracks down here around the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. To me, it is impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From the sound of the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. The sounds were high, and if it was down here, it wouldn't echo.
It would be a low sound. For a shot to echo, it has to be high up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean to hang?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. To hang like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now there were altogether three policemen assigned to the
corner of Elm and Houston; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were there any other men assigned down the length of Elm
Street here, that you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Not that I know of. There were no men stationed permanently
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The responsibility of control in that area would have been the
job of the motorcycle riders and the Secret Service men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are there any general orders that are issued to police officers
in regard to the scanning of windows when motorcades go by and that sort of
thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Well, in our training, we are told to scan windows, among lots
of things. Look on top of buildings, windows, cars, but, of course, these things
you are taught from the beginning. You don't have to be reminded of it every
day. That is what you are taught to do, and it would take too long to remind us
of everything they are supposed to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Every time you went out on an assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. Yes, sir; it would be impossible. That is why you are trained
for a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else that you saw or heard on that
day that you haven't told us about now, that you think we would be interested in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. No, sir; I believe that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you very much, officer, for coming in. We appreciate
your cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnett</span>. You are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="t544">TESTIMONY OF EDDY RAYMOND WALTHERS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Eddy Raymond Walthers was taken at 8:16 p.m., on July 23,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 361 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler, [spelling] L-i-e-b-e-l-e-r, and
I am an attorney on the staff of the President's Commission investigating the
assassination of President Kennedy. I have been authorized to take your testimony
by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order
11130, dated November 29, 1963, and joint resolution of Congress 137. Pursuant
to the rules of the Commission covering the taking of testimony, you are entitled
to have an attorney present and you are entitled to 3 days' notice of your hearing.
I know you didn't get the 3 days' notice of your hearing, but that can be waived
by the witness and I assume that since you are here you are prepared to proceed
and that we may proceed without your attorney being present?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you stand and take the oath, please? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Eddy Raymond Walthers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When and where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I was born here in Dallas County in 1928 on July 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I live at 2527 Boyd Street in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you presently a deputy sheriff in Dallas County, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you been a deputy sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. About 9 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you were in or about the area of the Texas
School Book Depository Building on November 22, 1963; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did you come to be there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I was standing in front of the sheriff's office on Main Street
and close to Houston with Mrs. Decker watching the parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, there is a building right there at the corner of Elm Street
and Houston Street, what has been referred to as the county building; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I was standing right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were standing over on Main Street just east of the intersection
of Main Street and Houston; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; just between the two buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you standing there when the motorcade came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you stood there and watched the motorcade go by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you acting in any official capacity at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I was a deputy sheriff&mdash;I was on duty and had stopped there
with Mrs. Decker to watch the parade go by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't have any specific assignment in connection with
the motorcade or the President or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The motorcade came down Main Street and made a wide turn
into Houston Street and went back down Elm Street; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the motorcade turned onto Houston Street, what did you
do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. After it turned onto Houston and most of the motorcade went
by, I turned to talk to Mrs. Decker and asked her if she was ready to go back
inside and I proceeded to help her back up the steps and then we heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You actually were still standing over on Main Street around the
corner from Houston Street when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You actually didn't see any of the shots take effect or anything
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I remember three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you clear about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do after you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Well, I was facing her and I told her that sounded like a rifle
and I ran across here [indicating] and there is a wall along in here and I hopped
over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean you ran across Houston Street and jumped over the
wall and back into Dealey Plaza there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. People were laying down on this grass&mdash;women and men
were laying on top of their children on the grass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On either side of Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; and then someone, I don't know, I say someone&mdash;a lot
of people was sitting there&mdash;but it must have been behind that fence&mdash;there's a
fence right along <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are referring to the area immediately behind the No. 7 that
appears on Commission Exhibit No. 354&mdash;there is a concrete structure there of
some sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. It don't show on this, but since this picture was made, there's
a fence&mdash;it may be there&mdash;it's a solid board fence along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Running along behind the concrete structure that faces Elm
Street and is No. 7 on Commission Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. And at that time I heard the shots as well as everybody else,
but as we got over this fence, and a lot of officers and people were just rummaging
through the train yards back in this parking area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the parking area down there? West of the Texas School
Book Depository Building between the Texas School Book Depository and the
railroad tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; and the discussion came up among several of the officers,
Were there any shots fired? And I said, "Well, they sounded like rifle
shots to me." At the time no one knew&mdash;in our crowd they were sure the shots
had been fired though because of the reports&mdash;we heard the noise, and I left then
and went back up here and came back onto the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Up on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. And went over on this grassy area right in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Between Elm Street and Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Between Elm and Main and starting to looking at the grass
to see if some shots had been fired and some of them might have chugged into
this turf here and it would give an indication if some had really been, if they
were really shots and not just blanks or something, and a man, and I couldn't
tell you his name if my life depended on it&mdash;he had a car parked right here
in Main Street&mdash;in the Main Street lane headed east, just under this underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Down at the point marked No. 9 of the exhibit we are talking
about; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. That's right&mdash;in this lane here and his car was just partially
sticking out parked there and he came up to me and asked me, he said, "Are you
looking to see where some bullets may have struck?" And I said, "Yes." He
says, "I was standing over by the bank here, right there where my car is parked
when those shots happened," and he said, "I don't know where they came from,
or if they were shots, but something struck me on the face," and he said, "It
didn't make any scratch or cut and it just was a sting," and so I had him show
me right where he was standing and I started to search in that immediate area
and found a place on the curb there in the Main Street lane there close to
the underpass where a projectile had struck that curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you remember that man's name if I told you or if I
reminded you of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I'm sorry&mdash;I don't know if I would remember it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is a man by the name of Jim Tague [spelling], T-a-g-u-e,
who works as an automobile salesman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I remember he had a gray automobile&mdash;I remember that very
well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think it must have been Mr. Tague because he was in here
this afternoon and he told me his car was parked right there at No. 9 and that's
when I put the mark on the exhibit and he walked up there and talked to a
deputy sheriff and he looked at the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; this was pure ignorance on my part in not getting his
name&mdash;I don't know&mdash;but I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think it is pretty clear it was Mr. Tague, because his testimony
he gave today jibed with yours and it couldn't have been anybody else
and he had a cut and some blood on his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Well, at the time I wasn't interested in whether he was cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
or what, I just said, "Where were you standing?" In an effort to prove there
was some shots fired, and after seeing the way it struck the curb at an angle&mdash;which
it came down on the curb&mdash;it was almost obvious that it either came
from this building or this building [indicating] the angle it struck the curb at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say this building or this building you are talking
about the School Book Depository Building or the building immediately east
thereof, across Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; and I ran right then back up along in here and that
would be right at the corner of Elm and Houston, where I ran into one of
our deputies, Allan Sweatt, and told him&mdash;everybody still at this time was
just&mdash;I don't know what you would call it&mdash;just running around in circles
you might say, and I told him, I said, "A bullet struck that curb. It's fresh&mdash;you
can see a fresh ricochet where it had struck," and I said, "From the
looks of it, it's probably going to be in this School Book Building," and immediately
then everybody started surrounding the School Book Building and
then I got off and come up the street here that runs in front of the School
Book Depository Building and started gathering up a bunch of witnesses and
started taking them over and put them in our office so we could get some
statements before they got all jumbled up together with their stories.</p>

<p>I continued to take witnesses across the street here and locked them up
and got our secretaries to start taking depositions from them before they
had a chance to get their stories messed up, and I don't remember who it
was now that came&mdash;as I was coming out the back door of the jail, out of the
office building here and said an officer had been killed in Oak Cliff and there
wasn't anybody over there, everybody was down here, and I got a couple of our
civil deputies and put them in a car and went to Oak Cliff, and left all this
area where the shooting was&mdash;where the shooting had taken place&mdash;and just at
the time I reached Zangs and Jefferson in Oak Cliff, I had a little transistor
radio in my car, and that's the first time I knew the President was actually
shot. They announced the fact that he was actually dead on the Citizens radio
and immediately after that we got a call that a suspect that was supposed
to have shot Officer Tippit was in the library building on Marsalis and Jefferson,
and everybody that had made it to Oak Cliff then went to that library and we
bailed out and surrounded it and found out that it was no good. It was not
the suspect, and then we got back in the car and got the call to go to the Texas
Theatre, that the suspect was in the balcony of the Texas Theatre on Jefferson,
and I parked there just east of the entrance and out in the traffic lane, and
I had a sawed off shotgun that I took with me inside the building and went
up the steps to the landing there and got hold of the manager and asked
him to turn on the house lights, and he said, "I'll go get some flashlights." I
said, "No, you can turn on the house lights, we're looking for a man," and I
went on into the balcony and there wasn't anybody in the balcony. It was
vacant. I ran to the rail then and looked downstairs and the house lights
had just came on and it wasn't too bright, even with them on, and we seen
some confusion down in the center section close to the back of the center
section of the seats and I hollered to another bunch of officers that were still
pouring in the balcony, "He must be downstairs," or, "He is downstairs," or
something to that effect and I ran back down the steps then and I laid my
shotgun down there across a couple of seats there and went into the aisle
where a scuffle was taking place and seen two hands wrapped around a pistol.
Like I say, it was dark even above the seats and down between the seats it
was pretty much of a mess to tell what was really happening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This man that had both hands up was down there between the
seats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Well, there were two different hands wrapped around the gun
holding onto it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Two different people fighting for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; and there were a lot of officers jumping over the seats
coming back to where it was happening, and Mr. B.&nbsp;K. Carroll that works up at
the city was coming right in on the same row I was in from the opposite side
facing me and I grabbed ahold of the hands that had the gun and about that
time two or three other officers piled into the scuffle there in between the seats and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
I was real sure it was Carroll that got the pistol out of his hands, or pulled it
away from the hands and then some uniformed officers just gathered this boy that
turned out to be Oswald up in a bunch, you might say, and I picked my shotgun
up and Mr. McDonald, I remember seeing him pick his hat up off of the floor
and standing over at the edge of everything and dusting his hat off when we got
ready to come out with him, and I got the shotgun, and a lot of people had congregated
out in front of the show and there's kind of an island there that goes
all the way out into the street and people were all over it and I had gotten the
shotgun and turned it sideways like a battering ram to get through and they
were all raising hell and cussing and saying what they wanted to do, "Let us
have him," and they wadded him up in the car and left with him, and then I
got in my car and somewhere in the shuffle I lost the two officers I had with me&mdash;I
don't remember how they got back to the station, but I remember leaving them&mdash;I
couldn't find them, so I went on back to the station then and Mr. Decker gave
me an address on a little piece of paper&mdash;I thought I could remember the address
in Irving where this Oswald had been staying with Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it 2515 West Fifth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I believe it was&mdash;5th or 15th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I believe it was Fifth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; and I took our officer, Harry Weatherford, and we met
Officer Adamcik that works for the city and Officer Rose and another one of
their officers, but I don't recall his name right now&mdash;at this address in Irving
and when we went to the door, what turned out to be Mrs. Paine&mdash;just as soon
as we stepped on the porch, she said, "Come on in, we've been expecting you,"
and we didn't have any trouble at all&mdash;we just went right on in and started asking
her&mdash;at that time it didn't appear that her or Mrs. Oswald, or Marina, who
came up carrying one of the babies in the living room&mdash;it didn't appear that they
knew that Oswald had been arrested at all&mdash;the way they talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you account for the fact that Mrs. Paine said, "Come on
in, we've been expecting you?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I don't know&mdash;to this day, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you sure that's what she said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I know that's what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Paine said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes, sir; she said, "Come on in, we have been expecting you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anybody else there that heard her say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I imagine all the officers on the porch did. I know Rose was
trying to show her his credentials and she just pushed the screen open and said,
Come on in. Now, after we got inside and we were making a search of the
house with their permission, they had no objection whatsoever. Mrs. Oswald
couldn't speak much English and Mr. Rose was doing most of the questioning,
the city officer. We were just&mdash;not actually knowing what we were looking for,
just searching, and we went into the garage there and found this&mdash;I believe it
was one of these things like soap comes in, a big pasteboard barrel and it had
a lot of these little leaflets in it, "Freedom for Cuba" and they were gold color
with black printing on them, and we found those and we also found a gray blanket
with some red trim on it that had a string tied at one end that you could see
the imprint of a gun, I mean where it had been wrapped in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You could really see the imprint of the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. You could see where it had been&mdash;it wasn't completely untied&mdash;one
end had been untied and the other end had been left tied, that would be
around the barrel and you could see where the gun had rested on the inside of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean by that, you could tell that from the way the thing
had been tied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. You could tell it from the way it was tied and the impression
of where that barrel went up in it where it was tied, that a rifle had been tied in
it, but what kind&mdash;you couldn't tell, but you could tell a rifle had been wrapped
up in it, and then we found some little metal file cabinets&mdash;I don't know what
kind you would call them&mdash;they would carry an 8 by 10 folder, all right, but
with a single handle on top of it and the handle moves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About how many of them would you think there were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. There were six or seven, I believe, and I put them all in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
trunk of my car and we also found a box of pictures, a bunch of pictures that we
taken. We didn't go to the trouble of looking at any of this stuff much&mdash;just
more or less confiscated it at the time, and we looked at it there&mdash;just like that,
and then we took all this stuff and put it in the car and then Mrs. Paine got a
phone number from Mrs. Oswald where you could call Lee Harvey Oswald in
Oak Cliff. It was a Whitehall phone number, I believe, and they said they
didn't know where he lived, but this was where they called him, and I called
Sheriff Decker on the phone when I was there and gave him that number for
the criss-cross, so they could send some men to that house, which I think they
did, but I didn't go myself. Then we put everybody in the car, the kids, Mrs.
Oswald, and everyone&mdash;no; just a minute&mdash;before that, though, this Michael
Paine or Mitchell Paine, whichever you call it, came home and I had understood
from Mrs. Paine already that they weren't living together, that they were separated
and he was supposed to be living in Grand Prairie and when he showed
up I asked him what was his object in coming home. He said&mdash;well, after he
had heard about the President's getting shot, he just decided he would take off
and come home, and he arrived there while we were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was already after the time Oswald had been arrested, of
course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because you had actually helped arrest Oswald at the Texas
Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And what time was it approximately, would you be able to
give us that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Oh, man&mdash;I couldn't tell you; I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald was arrested about what time&mdash;it must have been
around close to 2 o'clock or 1:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. It was between 1:30 and 2 o'clock. This wasn't his getting off
time, I remember him saying he had taken off and he had worked at Bell
Helicopter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It's perfectly possible, however, that he could have heard about
Oswald having been arrested in connection with the Officer Tippit shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. But he didn't say anything about that when he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I didn't ask him, of course, if he knew he had been arrested.
I asked him if he knew Oswald and he said, "Yes"; he had known him. We
were standing, I remember, on each side of the ironing board when I talked to
him and he said "Yes," he had known him and I said, "How does the guy think,
what is he, what does he do?" He said, "He's a Communist. He is very communistic
minded. He believes in it." And he says, "He used to try to convince
me it was a good thing," and he says, "I don't believe in it." And our
conversation didn't go too far. It was just a matter of talk about Oswald and
what he had to say about him being a Communist.</p>

<p>They were all put in the cars and we took them to Capt. Will Fritz' office
along with the stuff we had confiscated, the files and the blanket and the other
stuff, and I turned them over to Captain Fritz and left them and went back to
my station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was in these file cabinets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. We didn't go through them at the scene. I do remember a
letterhead&mdash;I can't describe it&mdash;I know we opened one of them and we seen
what it was, that it was a lot of personal letters and stuff and a letterhead
that this Paine fellow had told us about, and he said, "That's from the people
he writes to in Russia"; he was talking about this letterhead we had pulled
out and so I just pushed it all back down and shut it and took the whole works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have been advised that some story has developed that at
some point that when you went out there you found seven file cabinets full of
cards that had the names on them of pro-Castro sympathizers or something of
that kind, but you don't remember seeing any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Well, that could have been one, but I didn't see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There certainly weren't any seven file cabinets with the stuff you
got out there or anything like that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I picked up all of these file cabinets and what all of them
contained, I don't know myself to this day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As I was sitting here listening to your story, I could see where
that story might have come from&mdash;you mentioned the "Fair Play for Cuba" leaflets
that were in a barrel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. That's right&mdash;we got a stack of them out of that barrel, but
things get all twisted around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There has also been a story, some sort of story that you were
supposed to have found a spent bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; that's what the story was in this book, and man, I've
never made a statement about finding a spent bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you never found any spent bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No; me and Allan Sweatt 2 or 3 days after the assassination
did go back down there and make a pretty diligent search in there all up where
that bullet might have hit, thinking that maybe the bullet hit the cement and
laid down on some of them beams but we looked all up there and everywhere
and I never did find one. I never did in all of my life tell anybody I found a
bullet other than where it hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Also, actually, if you were standing down here in front of this
building on Main Street at the time the shots were fired, I suppose you could have
seen down there to this railroad track trestle that goes over the underpass, did
you have occasion to look down there at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No; it never even entered my mind, and knowing how this
thing is arranged and I have chased a couple of escapees across the thing before,
and knowing what was over there, the thought that anyone was shooting from
back in here&mdash;I've heard some people say he was behind the fence, and I'm
telling you, it just can't be, because it's a wide open river bottom area as far as
you can go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It's a river bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; and the thought that anyone would be shooting off of
there would almost be an impossible thing&mdash;there's no place for him to go&mdash;there's
nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you certainly never saw anybody firing from the tops of
those railroad tracks, I mean, you never told anybody you saw someone firing
from up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No, sir; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never told anybody that one of the shots had come from
the top of those railroad tracks either; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you sure that what you saw there on the curb was a
ricochet mark or could you clearly identify that in your own mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; it was a fresh ricochet mark. I have seen them and I
noticed it for the next 2 or 3 days as it got grayer and grayer and grayer as it
aged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What curb was it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. It would be on the south Main Street curb&mdash;it would be on the
south side of Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, looking at Commission Exhibit No. 354 here and I am
looking at&mdash;looking specifically at spot No. 9 on that exhibit, it would have
been directly east up Main Street on the north curb at No. 9, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes, and about&mdash;I could step this off here&mdash;just about this
distance from the underpass on the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About 12 or 15 feet or something like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I imagine about 10 or 11 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, here's a picture that has been marked Tague Exhibit No. 1
and I have never even been able to figure out which way it is supposed to be
looked at, but it purports to be a picture of a ricochet mark on this curb down
there, does that look anything like what you saw down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes, a little at one end where it first hit and then went to the
left. This would be&mdash;this was shaded from the sun by someone's hand, evidently.
This would actually be the curb&mdash;this would be the street right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The lower part&mdash;the black part of the dark colored part?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes. Let me see now. A picture taken straight down like
this don't have any particular bearing. I'll tell you what&mdash;this is going to be
the divider between the pavement, because I remember, there's not any grass
growing down there, it's just a gravel looking top, so this is going to be the
street, and that's right, because the bullet is going to be big where it hit first, and
then it left this trail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think that the light colored part is the street and the
dark colored part is the divider?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I think it would be the street&mdash;the light colored part, and the
dark colored part is this little gravelly looking part down there and it's under
the shade of the underpass and no grass will grow there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The light colored part is a part of the street and the dark colored
part is the curb and there is what appears to be a ricochet mark on the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes; because it is high like&mdash;this is the curb and this is the
street, and it come along this edge of the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Toward the top of the curb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. And it angled down&mdash;at the angle, you could almost just point
it right back up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Toward the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Evidently this shot must have went way high over that car&mdash;the
last shot, as they were fixing to go to the underpass&mdash;it must have been
awful high to hit where it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say it was the last shot, why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I would say it was the last shot because of the distance it
went down towards the underpass. Had there been another shot, it would have
been way&mdash;would have went way back over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The car had already been down&mdash;the car would have already
been under and by the underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else you saw or observed that day
that you can tell us about what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you were there at the Texas Theatre helping to arrest
Oswald, did you hear Oswald say anything when they tried to get ahold of
him and tried to get him out of there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Like I say, there was quite a scuffle between them, but I heard
him say, "It's all over now, it's all over now," or something to that degree, and
I can't be sure, because like I say, there was such a scuffle going on and there
was so much confusion, but he said something about, "Now"&mdash;"It's over now,"
or, "It's all over now."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know if anybody else heard anything that he said at the
time; have you discussed this with anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I haven't discussed it because the officers that were there
were not in my squad and I haven't talked to anybody about it, but there were
some other officers around there. Some of our officers were there but they
weren't right there in the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear&mdash;there have been some stories that he actually
tried to shoot one of the officers there with that pistol and one of the officers
heard that pistol&mdash;the hammer hit the bullet, did you hear anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When I say, "Did you hear anything like that," I mean, did
you hear the hammer in the pistol hit the bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear somebody say that it hit the bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I think McDonald said he snapped it at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't hear it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you do think that Oswald said something like this&mdash;"It's
over, it's all over now?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. He said something&mdash;when he was being pulled up out of the
seat and as they were getting the gun away from him is when he made a remark
about, "It's over now, it's all over now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After he had been subdued and they got his gun away from him,
he said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you can't think of anything else that I haven't asked you
about, I don't think I have any more questions. I want to thank you very much
for coming in and giving us your testimony, especially being as late as it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walthers</span>. I'm sorry if I was a little evasive on some of this, but I
didn't remember&mdash;it's been quite a while now. Of course, I have the statement
that I made immediately following all this, I guess, they sent you a copy of
it. It would probably have a little more of the time and dates on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have covered the basic points that I wanted to cover and
that's all. Thank you very much for coming.</p>

that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That's correct; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us how you happened to be there and what
you saw, and what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I was going downtown to pick up my wife&mdash;she was my girl
that I was going with at the time&mdash;to take her to lunch, and I accidentally
came upon the motorcade.</p>

<p>I was not planning to watch the parade or anything. There were several
cars stopped in front of me, and I stopped there myself under the triple underpass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
and got out and was standing there just, oh, about a minute before the
President's car came by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was your car actually located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. The nose of the car was sticking out from underneath the triple
underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What street were you on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. What is the farthest street to the south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Commerce; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Commerce Street is one-way going east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So they stopped all traffic on Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Cars in the left lane were stopping, the ones next to the curb, and
several cars had stopped in front of me, and I stopped. The car was just halfway
out from underneath the underpass, and I got out of my car and stood by
the bridge abutment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you were just out from under the triple underpass so that you
could see the President's car and the motorcade coming on down Elm Street,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see the motorcade come down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead and tell us what you saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Well, I was standing there watching, and really I was watching
to try to distinguish the President and his car. About this time I heard what
sounded like a firecracker. Well, a very loud firecracker. It certainly didn't
sound like a rifleshot. It was more of a loud cannon-type sound. I looked
around to see who was throwing firecrackers or what was going on and I turned
my head away from the motorcade and, of course, two more shots.</p>

<p>And I ducked behind the post when I realized somebody was shooting after the
third shot. After the third shot, I ducked behind the bridge abutment and
was there for a second, and I glanced out and just as I looked out, the car
following the President's car, the one with the Secret Service men, was just
flying past at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Going on Elm Street under the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right. Going on Elm. So I stood there looking around. I
looked up&mdash;there was a motorcycle policeman, and he stopped and had drawn his
gun and was running up the embankment toward the railroad tracks. A crowd
of people; several people, were starting to come down into that area where he
was running, and the people pointing, and excitement up there and so on, and
about that time a patrolman who evidently had been stationed under the triple
underpass walked up and said, "What happened?" and I said, "I don't know;
something."</p>

<p>And we walked up to the&mdash;by this time the motorcycle policeman returned
back close to where his motorcycle was, and we walked up there and there was a
man standing there. Seeing that he was very excited&mdash;I don't remember his
name&mdash;at the time I did have it on the tip of my tongue&mdash;very excited saying
he was watching the President and it seemed like his head just exploded. This
was a couple or 3 minutes after this happened. And the patrolman said, "Well,
I saw something fly off back on the street."</p>

<p>We walked back down there, and another man joined us who identified himself
as the deputy sheriff, who was in civilian clothes, and I guess this was 3 or
4 minutes after. I don't know how to gage time on something like that.</p>

<p>And I says, "Well, you know now, I recall something sting me on the face
while I was standing down there."</p>

<p>And he looked up and he said, "Yes; you have blood there on your cheek."</p>

<p>And I reached up and there was a couple of drops of blood. And he said,
Where were you standing?</p>

<p>And I says, "Right down here." We walked 15 feet away when this deputy
sheriff said, "Look here on the curb." There was a mark quite obviously that
was a bullet, and it was very fresh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
We turned around and we looked back up to see where this possibly could have
come from, and the policeman thought he had seen something over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, now, I have some pictures here and I will show you to
indicate these places, an aerial view of the whole area, Commission Exhibit
No. 354. Of course, the Texas School Book Depository Building is here on the
left, and this is the triple underpass here, and this, of course, is Commerce
Street going toward the east.</p>

<p>As I understand it, your car was just nosed out in the left-hand lane of
Commerce Street and was just out from under the railroad tracks that go over
the triple underpass, so the nose of your car was on the easternmost portion, on
the eastern side of the railroad tracks that go over the triple underpass, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now did you get out of your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do? Did you stay near your car or did you
walk on the area toward the grassy plaza?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I was standing 3 or 4 feet in front of the concrete embankment
right here [pointing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's make a No. 6 on this picture as to where you were standing.
This is the concrete strip that runs between Commerce and Main Street
right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I was standing about right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At No. 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, that is where you were standing when you apparently
got hit with this flying, whatever it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then after you had run into this deputy sheriff, you looked
along the street and you saw what you thought to be a mark made by <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. A motorcycle was parked here and the policeman was here on the
grass right here, and there was a swarm of people around him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At No. 7. Let's put a No. 7 there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. This man was relating his story of how he was standing right
there as he witnessed the facts. He said it looked like the President's head
exploded. And I said I felt something hit me. We walked down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Toward No. 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right. When we got within about 20 feet, the deputy sheriff
spotted the place about 12 to 15 feet out from the embankment on the curb, and
turned around, and we looked up here where the policeman originally ran up
on the grass here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is an area circled here with the letter "C" in it. Is
that where the policeman ran toward the grassy area; included in that circle,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right. I pointed this out, and we turned around and looked
toward the School Book Depository, and from the reflection of the sun it was
something on the window. Not the&mdash;well, it is maybe five or six windows
which were open, which it was not the window that proved to be where the
shots were fired, but it was a different window like it had spider webs or dust,
and maybe shots had come through the window.</p>

<p>We said maybe this is where they came from. And the deputy sheriff ran back
to the policeman. I may not be quite accurate, but I believe at the time there
was a whole swarm of motorcycle policemen coming back to the area under the
underpass going the wrong way here on Elm.</p>

<p>They came back and parked, and he mentioned to them&mdash;that is probably 5
minutes after it happened, and he was on the radio, and everybody ran up
around the School Book Depository at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go back and fix the general spot when the deputy sheriff
saw the mark on the street, going back to point No. 6, which is where you were
standing when you were hit. We go east <span class="locked">along&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right here is a curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is a curb that runs <span class="locked">along&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. About 12 to 15 feet right on the top of round of the curb, was the
mark that very definitely was fresh, and I would say it was a mark of a bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say it is about 15 or 20 feet east of where you were
standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. No; about 12 to 15 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. East of where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At point No. 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So we have the point fixed there, and we can just estimate 12 to
15 feet east on Main Street, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would have been on the south curb of Main Street, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. It would have been on the south curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About 12 to 15 feet east of the point No. 6 on Commission Exhibit
No. 354.</p>

<p>Now you yourself, as I understand it, did not see the President hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I did not; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long after did you feel yourself get hit by anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I felt it at the time, but I didn't associate, didn't make any connection,
and ignored it. And after this happened, or maybe the second or third
shot, I couldn't tell you definitely&mdash;I made no connection. I looked around
wondering what was going on, and I recall this. We got to talking, and I recall
that something had stinged me, and then the deputy sheriff looked up and said,
You have blood there on your cheek. That is when we walked back down
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any idea which bullet might have made that mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I would guess it was either the second or third. I wouldn't say
definitely on which one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear any more shots after you felt yourself get hit in
the face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I believe that it was the second shot, so I heard the third shot
afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I heard three shots; yes sir. And I did notice the time on the
Hertz clock. It was 12:29.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was about the time that you felt yourself struck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I just glanced. I mean I just stopped, got out of my car, and here
came the motorcade. I just happened upon the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now I understand that you went back there subsequently and
took some pictures of the area, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you went back subsequently and took some
pictures of the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes; about a month ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With a motion picture camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes; I didn't know anybody knew about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you Baker Exhibit No. 1, and ask you if you took that
picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. No; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In point of fact, that picture was taken by another individual;
I confused the picture taken by somebody else with the picture I thought you had
taken.</p>

<p>You, yourself did take pictures of the area about a month ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes; my wife and I were going to Indianapolis. This is the home
of my parents. I was taking some pictures of the area to show to them. This
was the latter part of May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you look at the curb at that time to see if the mark was still
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Not that I could tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you meet a newspaper photographer that day and talk to
him at all about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. The day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Not that I can recall. I left the area down there at about a
quarter to one, and the officer there told me to go to the police headquarters
and report to somebody down there and tell them what I had seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Referring now to Baker Exhibit No. 1, does that look like it
might have been taken from approximately the place where you were standing
at the time you got hit, from the same general area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I believe I was back further to the left, back down this way
further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is further toward the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Further down toward the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it appear to you that the lamppost that is showing right here
on the right-hand side of Baker Exhibit No. 1 is the very end of the grassy area
described by Commerce Street and Main Street, and right down toward the
concrete embankment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. It might possibly be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you able to tell for sure by looking at Baker Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have another picture here that purports to be a picture of a
curb with a bullet mark on it. I ask you if that looks like what you saw that
day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. It looks similar, but I can't say whether this is the actual one or
not, because you can see it appears to be a bullet mark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have initialed this picture, having marked it Tague Exhibit
No. 1, and I would like to have you initial it for the purpose of identification.</p>

<p>(Mr. Tague initials.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You indicate that the mark on the <span class="locked">curb&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I can't tell too much which angle of the curb this is or what here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is not a very clear picture either. Actually, I can't figure
which way to look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I can't either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It looks like there is a man standing there with a hand along
the side of the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes; this looks like the curb here at the back and the sun shining
down. The bullet mark was right at the circle of the curb as this here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In other words, where the curb turned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right. At the very round, right in the middle of the round.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is where the street curb turns; when it turns there? I
don't understand that. [Looking at Commission Exhibit No. 354.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. This right here, this picture was taken this way. It would be
looking this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I am still at a loss. You indicated there is a turn in the curb
at some point along here. Does the curb end and the road go together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Here is the curb here I am talking about on the very round.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On the round top of the curb? The curb itself continues on,
but the bullet struck sort of the top edge of the curb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand. Did you have any idea where these shots came
from when you heard them ringing out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes; I thought they were coming from my left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Immediately to your left, or toward the back? Of course, now
we have other evidence that would indicate that the shots did come from
the Texas School Book Depository, but see if we can disregard that and determine
just what you heard when the shots were fired in the first place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. To recall everything is almost impossible. Just an impression
is all I recall, is the fact that my first impression was that up by the, whatever
you call the monument, or whatever it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Up above No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That somebody was throwing firecrackers up there, that the police
were running up there to see what was going on, and this was my first impression.
Somebody was causing a disturbance, that somebody had drawn
a gun and was shooting at the crowd, and the police were running up to it.
When I saw the people throwing themselves on the ground is when I realized
there was serious trouble, and I believe that was after the third shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your impression of where the shots came from was much the
result of the activity near No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Not when I heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You thought they had come from the area between Nos. 7 and 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I believe they came from up in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Back in the area "C"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Behind the concrete monument here between Nos. 5 and 7,
toward the general area of "C"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you look up near the railroad tracks in that area after you
heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I looked all around. I looked at the complete area to try to
find out where the disturbance was. And for some reason, after the third
shot, I believe I ducked down back in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Under the railroad tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Right. Behind an abutment. And when I stuck my head outside,
the Secret Service car was just starting to pass under the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The car immediately behind the President. Did you see any
evidence of anybody having fired from the area on the railroad tracks above
the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think that it is consistent with what you heard and
saw that day, that the shots could have come from the sixth floor of the
Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was in fact a considerable echo in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. There was no echo from where I stood. I was asked this question
before, and there was no echo. It was just a loud, oh, not a cannon, but
definitely louder and more solid than a rifleshot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you, being in a place where there was no echo, you were
able to recognize how many shots there were quite clearly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you say you heard three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember seeing anything else or observing anything
else that day that you think would be helpful to the Commission, that I haven't
asked you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Not that I can think of. There is lots of things that you recall
about something like that, that you don't recall for certain. What struck me
the most was that everybody said all three shots were accounted for. I felt
very strongly that the third shot hit down there, and there was the deputy
sheriff and the patrolman down under the bridge right there with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you say you thought it was the third shot that hit down
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. No; I said I thought that all three shots were accounted for.
All the newspaper accounts for months said all the shots were accounted for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In terms of hitting in the car?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Hitting into the car; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, there was a story in the paper more recently that indicated
that one of them might have missed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That's right; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than that, is there anything that you can think of that
you think the Commission should know about of what you heard and saw that
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. No; I don't know a thing. The only thing that I saw that I
thought was wrong was that there was about 5 or 6 or 7 minutes in there before
anybody done anything about anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was after the shots were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. That was after the shots were fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What do you mean, "Before they did anything"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. There was no action taken except for the one policeman that
I could see that stopped his motorcycle, and it fell over on him at first, and
he got it standing upright and drew his gun, and he was the only one doing
anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't see any other policemen around in the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Not for 4 or 5 minutes. If Oswald was in that building, he
had all the time in the world to calmly walk out of there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Apparently that is just what he did do. Well, if you can't
think of anything else, Mr. Tague, I want to thank you for coming in and for
the cooperation you have given us. We appreciate it very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tague</span>. Okay.</p>

<h2 id="t558">TESTIMONY OF EMMETT J. HUDSON</h2>

<p>The testimony of Emmett J. Hudson was taken at 10:40 a.m., on July 22,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you raise your right hand and take the oath? Do you
solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am an attorney on the staff
of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have been authorized to take your testimony by the Commission
pursuant to authority granted to it by Executive Order 11130, dated
November 29, 1963, and the joint resolution of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the rules of the Commission you are entitled to have an attorney
present, if you wish, and you are entitled to 3 days' notice of the hearing. I
don't think you did get 3 days' notice of it, but since you are here I assume
you are willing to go ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you want to have an attorney present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. I don't know that it is necessary&mdash;no, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No; I don't think it is at all necessary. Most of the witnesses
don't have one present. We just have a few questions. Will you state your
full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Emmett J. Hudson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. 107 South Bishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is my understanding that you are employed by the Dallas
Park Department and you are the grounds keeper of Dealey Plaza; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you the grounds keeper of Dealey Plaza on or about November
22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; I have been there about 6 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us where you were on November 22, 1963, at
around noon, around the time the Presidential motorcade came by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; I was over there next to that T. &amp; P. Railroad yard where
the little toolshed was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the nearest intersection to where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Elm and what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How far away from the corner of Elm and Houston were you
at the time the motorcade came by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Oh, I suppose that it's about&mdash;the best I can estimate is somewhere
about 200 yards, I guess, down Elm and Houston when the motorcade came
along&mdash;that's about where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were right by where the motorcade came by; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us to the best of your recollection what you saw
and tell us just what happened when the motorcade came along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, I was standing on those steps that came straight down to
Elm there, just above that triple underpass, I was about halfway between the
triple underpass and Houston, where the steps are&mdash;somewhere near about halfway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you a photograph which is No. 18 of Commission Exhibit
No. 875. It depicts the street and the triple underpass. Can you show us on
that picture, if that picture shows it the place where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Let me see&mdash;that's the triple underpass down there&mdash;I don't believe
this picture gets those steps&mdash;yes; it does, too&mdash;here they are&mdash;I recognize
it now&mdash;here it is right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where are the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Here they are&mdash;right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is the series of steps that runs right down the street there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you show me just where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, I was right along&mdash;you see, the steps come down the steps
for a way and then there is a broad place, oh, I'll say it is a little wider than
this table here on the steps and then some steps and I was standing on this&mdash;that
would be somewhere around along about there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me just mark on that picture the place where you were
standing so that we can have that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Right along about there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was right here where I have placed this "X", is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; right along in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you were standing about where I placed the "X" on photograph
No. 18 of Commission Exhibit No. 875. Tell me what you saw&mdash;tell me
what happened to the best of your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, there was a young fellow, oh, I would judge his age about
in his late twenties. He said he had been looking for a place to park and he
walked up there and he said he finally just taken a place over there in one of
them parking lots, and he come on down there and said he worked over there on
Industrial and me and him both just sat down there first on those steps. When
the motorcade turned off of Houston onto Elm, we got up and stood up, me and
him both. He was on the left side and I was on the right and so the first shot
rung out and, of course, I didn't realize it was a shot, what was taking place
right at that present time, and when the second one rung out, the motorcade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
had done got further on down Elm, and you see, I was trying to get a good look
at President Kennedy. I happened to be looking right at him when that bullet
hit him&mdash;the second shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was when the bullet him him in the head; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; it looked like it hit him somewhere along about a little bit
behind the ear and a little bit above the ear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On the right-hand side or the left-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me approximately where the President's car was
when you heard what you later figured out was the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, the best I could get right off&mdash;I remember it was right
along about this lightpost right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are indicating the first lightpost on the right-hand side of
Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; coming off of Houston, you see, there's a lightpost right
there close to the Houston Street, right there, just above this little crook right
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That lightpost doesn't show in the picture you have here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir; it doesn't show in the picture&mdash;it was about, I believe,
where the first shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think he was by the lightpost in this picture when the first
shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Right along there is about where President Kennedy's car was
when he was hit&mdash;at the time I was looking right at him when the shot struck
him, when the bullet struck him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many shots did you hear altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you sure about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that it was the second shot that hit him in the head;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; I do believe that&mdash;I know it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You saw him hit in the head, there wasn't any question in your
mind about that, was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And after you saw him hit in the head, did you hear another
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see that shot hit anything&mdash;the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir. I'll tell you&mdash;this young fellow that was sitting there
with me&mdash;standing there with me at the present time, he says, "Lay down,
Mister, somebody is shooting the President." He says, "Lay down, lay down,"
and he kept on repeating, "Lay down," so he was already laying down one way
on the sidewalk, so I just laid down over on the ground and resting my arm on
the ground and when that third shot rung out and when I was close to the
ground&mdash;you could tell the shot was coming from above and kind of behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How could you tell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, just the sound of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You heard it come from sort of behind the motorcade and
then above?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; I don't know if you have ever laid down close to the
ground, you know, when you heard the reports coming, but it's a whole lot
plainer than it is when you are standing up in the air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were standing down here where we put the "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that when the President was hit in the head he was
up here by the first lamppost on the right-hand side of the post that shows in
the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; right along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's when he got hit in the head?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you sure about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you had to look up Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; I was looking up this way, you see. You see [indicating
on photograph], that's the motorcade car right there, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; the picture that we are looking at here is a picture of a reenactment
of the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; so right along about even with these steps, pretty close to
even with this here, the last shot was fired&mdash;somewhere right along in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think that the last shot was fired and the car was about
where it actually is in that picture when the third shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Pretty close to it; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you think the President had already been hit in the head
by the time the third shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. He had been hit twice, so Parkland Hospital said. He was hit
in the neck one time and in the head one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When the first shot was fired, were you looking at the presidential
car then; could you see it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; it was coming around&mdash;it had just got around the corner,
you see, from off of Houston Street, making that corner there, come off of
Houston onto Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it look to you like the President was hit by the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir; I don't think so&mdash;I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't think he got hit by the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say it was the second shot that hit him in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What happened after the President got hit in the head, did you
see what he did, what happened in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. He slumped over and Mrs. Kennedy, she climbs over in the seat
with him and pulls him over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Pulled him down in the seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Pulled him over in her lap like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you don't think the President got hit by the first shot and
you say he got hit in the head with the second <span class="locked">shot&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And if we assume that he was hit twice, you would have to say
that he was hit by the third shot; isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was hit again after he got hit in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think that could have been possible when Mrs. Kennedy
pulled him over, do you think he could have got hit in the neck after he had
been hit in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was still sitting far enough up in the car he could have been
hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you watch the President after he got hit in the head like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, as soon as everybody realized what had happened, you
know, everybody went to going up the hill so we did too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you only saw the President hit once; is that right, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir; I just saw him hit once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you aren't able to say from your own observation when
he was hit in the neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If he was hit in the neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could the car have actually been down here where it is in photograph
No. 18, could it have been that far down Elm Street&mdash;this is Elm Street
that runs down here&mdash;right here&mdash;could the car have been that far down Elm
Street when the President got hit in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir; no, sir, it wasn't that far down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you see this little pedestal back up here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just above the "X" where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anybody standing up there that you can remember,
during the time the President went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Oh, there was a bunch of people in there, you know, a whole
bunch of them&mdash;a lot of people in there&mdash;a lot of people in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anybody standing up there taking motion pictures
with a movie camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Oh, yes; I seen people up there trying to get&mdash;taking pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see a man with a moving picture camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Not in particular, I didn't. It was such an exciting time&mdash;now&mdash;I
did notice a man back over here on this triangle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Standing across Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With a motion picture camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, he had a camera&mdash;I don't know whether it was a motion
picture camera or not, but he had a camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you another picture which we will mark as Hudson
Exhibit No. 1. I have put my initials on the back of the picture. Would you do
that too so we can identify the picture before we start to talk about it, so we
don't get confused?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. You mean&mdash;put my name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just your initials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. [Marked picture as requested.] Is that all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, let's take a look at that picture, Mr. Hudson, and let
me ask you if you can see in that picture, where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. (No response.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, this picture, Hudson Exhibit No. 1, has a sign in it
that says, "Stemmons Freeway, keep right," doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you find that sign on the photograph No. 18 of Commission
Exhibit No. 875? The one that we were talking about before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. That's right here, I believe&mdash;right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, that sign says, "R.&nbsp;L. Thornton Freeway, keep right."
Where is the Stemmons Freeway sign in this picture? Can you see it in that
picture at all&mdash;I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. I can't either&mdash;that isn't it&mdash;it's farther up this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's further back up and it's out of the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There are two signs in picture No. 18, one says, "R.&nbsp;L. Thornton
Freeway, keep right," and the other one says, "Fort Worth Turnpike, keep right."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. There were two of them that wasn't too far apart right
through there&mdash;them signs was&mdash;one was right along in here and the other one
was either further up, I guess. It's not in that picture&mdash;I don't believe. Now,
they have moved some of those signs. They have moved that R.&nbsp;L. Thornton
Freeway sign and put up a Stemmons sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They have? They have moved it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That might explain it, because this picture here, No. 18, was
taken after the assassination and this one was taken at the time&mdash;No. 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; it had to be right along in there&mdash;those steps have got
to come down right along in here, if I see the picture right. Now, this is Elm
right here coming down through here, and this is that concrete thing up here
that comes around like this&mdash;it comes over here and the steps begin right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
along up in there somewhere and come on down right here to the sidewalk,
right along in there somewhere to where those steps is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, that you think you were standing somewhere in the back
left-hand part of this picture where the steps come down off of the concrete
structure there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; this was taken at the present time&mdash;it happened&mdash;this picture
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; this is an actual picture of the motorcade itself; yes, sir.
Let me suggest that the pictures are taken from different angles, referring to
photograph No. 18 of Commission Exhibit No. 875&mdash;there is a little concrete
stand here in the very right-hand side of the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. That's just right along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's right, and that appears in Hudson Exhibit No. 1, immediately
to the right of the sign that says, "Stemmons Freeway, keep right."
does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; those steps are right along there between that concrete&mdash;the
end of that concrete wall right there and that elm tree come between
them&mdash;no, not an elm but that's a live oak tree&mdash;that's a live oak tree right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that's right off of the end of this concrete embankment
there, there's a live oak tree there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you see yourself in that picture anywhere, can you make
yourself out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir; I can't, unless it is one of these two men right here&mdash;I
can't tell&mdash;if I had that picture that was taken in the Times Herald paper&mdash;I
can show you myself in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Which one is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, it was in the Times Herald paper the next morning after,
I believe, after the assassination, maybe the evening after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Look at this picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. [Examining picture referred to.] I don't know&mdash;if that's one
of them men and myself or not up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have shown you Commission Exhibit No. 203, and you are not
able to point to yourself in that picture at any place. Actually, Commission
Exhibit No. 203 shows a different area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's a picture from the front of the Texas School Book Depository
Building and you wouldn't be in that picture, according to where you
placed yourself by looking at Hudson Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No; I wouldn't be in that at all&mdash;I know. If they had that
picture that was taken&mdash;a fellow was shooting from across Elm up toward
those steps here, that showed my picture in it, I believe. Now, I could be one
of those men standing right there&mdash;I'm not for sure&mdash;I wouldn't say for sure
that I was one of them or not, but I can't see it well enough to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In this picture here you see the car is going down Elm Street,
isn't that right, referring to Hudson Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And it is just about to pass a sign that says, "Stemmons Freeway,
keep right." Do you think that the President could have been hit when
he was that far back up Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You do think that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you had already heard one shot when you saw the President
get hit in the head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you heard another shot after that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think, looking at Hudson Exhibit No. 1, do you think
that that is about the place where the President got hit in the head, or was
it further back up on Elm or was it further down&mdash;if so&mdash;about where was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. That's somewhere pretty close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's pretty close right there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; it's somewhere pretty close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you heard these three shots and saw the President get
hit in the head, you turned around and you ran up on the little knoll there
and you got away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. While you were standing there, did you ever look up toward
the railroad tracks there where they went across the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir; while I was laying there I didn't&mdash;I was looking down
towards Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you never looked up towards the railroad tracks that went
across the underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you are quite sure in your own mind that the shots came
from the rear of the President's car and above it; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any idea that they might have come from the
Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, it sounded like it was high, you know, from above and kind
of behind like&mdash;in other words, to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that would have fit in with the Texas School Book Depository,
wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you look up there and see if you could see anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I never thought about looking up that way, to
tell you the truth about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were thinking about getting out of the way after things
started?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; it was just such an exciting time, you know, a fellow thinks
about a million things in one second there at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see anybody standing around there any place with a
rifle&mdash;on the grassy spot up there near where you were standing or on the overpass
or any place else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. I never seen anyone with a gun up there except the patrols.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The policemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you see anything else down there when this all happened
that you think we ought to know about that I haven't asked you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir; I don't know of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see Governor Connally&mdash;did you think Governor Connally
had been hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, sir; I never noticed Governor Connally in the car. The
first shot must have struck him and he had done fell over in the car when that
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that you didn't even see Governor Connally in the car at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't see him get hit by any of the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are assuming that maybe he got hit by the first shot and
fell down in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you saw the President get hit by what you heard as the
second shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How far apart were the shots spaced; do you have any recollection
about that, how long did it take for all the shots to be fired and how far
apart was one shot from the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, they was pretty fast and not too fast either. It seemed
like he had time enough to operate his gun plenty well&mdash;when the shots were all
fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much time do you think passed from the time the first shot
was fired until the second shot was fired, can you make any estimate about that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Oh, probably 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As much as 2 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. It might not have been that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you thought he had plenty of time to get all the shots off
anyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever do any shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, not no big rifle&mdash;I haven't never done no shooting with no
big rifle. I have shot shotguns&mdash;.22's and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the shots seem evenly spaced or were some of them closer
together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. They seemed pretty well evenly spaced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Evenly spaced; is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody talk to you at all about security arrangements
prior to the time the motorcade came by, or was that all handled by the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. That was all handled by the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't have anything to do with anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. That's right&mdash;the fact of the business is, I didn't know they had
been routed that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't even know it was going to go by until they came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you been interviewed by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Not by name, I don't; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And did you tell them approximately the same thing you have
told me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Yes; approximately the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the Secret Service talk to you, or the Dallas Police Department
or the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. The FBI and I made a deposition over at the courthouse&mdash;the
same day that the assassination was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was the Dallas Police Department or the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. The sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Okay, Mr. Hudson, I want to thank you very much for coming
in. I don't have any more questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. Well, if it has been any help, I am glad it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. If it has been any help, I am glad to come down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think you have been and we are glad to have you cooperate
with us in the way you have. I want to thank you very much on behalf of the
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>. All right, good day.</p>

<h2 id="t565">TESTIMONY OF EDGAR LEON SMITH, JR.</h2>

<p>The testimony of Edgar Leon Smith, Jr. was taken at 10:05 a.m., on July 24,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you raise your right hand and please take the oath?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am an attorney with the staff
of the President's Committee investigating the assassination of President Kennedy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
I have been authorized to take your testimony by the Commission, pursuant
to authority granted to it by Executive Order No. 11130, dated November
29, 1963, and the joint resolution of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>By the rules of the Commission covering the taking of testimony, you are
entitled to have an attorney present and you are entitled to 3 days' notice of
the hearing. I know that you haven't had 3 days' notice of the hearing because
of schedule difficulties that we had yesterday and the day before, but since you
are here by yourself, I presume you are prepared to go ahead and give your testimony
without an attorney being present; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Edgar Leon Smith, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where and when were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Myrtle Springs, Tex., July 9, 1933.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. 1800 Scripture, Apartment 6, in Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a Dallas policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. A Dallas policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you were in the vicinity of the Texas School
Book Depository Building on November 22, 1963; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us just what led up to that; how you came to be
assigned to that particular area and what instructions you were given about
what you were supposed to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Okay&mdash;the dates and times will be just approximately, because I
don't recall exactly, but approximately 9 a.m., November 22, 1963, I attended a
detail in the basement of the city hall for all men who were designated to work
traffic for the President's visit to Dallas.</p>

<p>At that detail I was given instructions by Captain Lawrence, P.&nbsp;W. Lawrence,
as to my duties and some things to watch out for. Some of these things I was
to watch out for was to watch the crowd for any unusual movements and also
to keep a check on the buildings in the vicinity of where I was located. He
instructed us specifically about placards. I understand that people were allowed
to carry placards, but if I should notice anyone attempting to throw them or anything
like that, I should take them into custody. I was assigned to the corner
of Houston and Elm Street. I got to my traffic corner <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before you get to that&mdash;let me ask you a few questions: What
did you say your name was, Edgar L.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. E. L.&mdash;Edgar L.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There were two Smiths on that corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; I understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you received your instructions that morning, was there
any specific mention made of watching the windows of the buildings in the
area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Not that I recall&mdash;just general&mdash;watch out, you know, for the
crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you went down to the corner of Elm and Houston and
took up your duty station there at about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I think it was about approximately 10 o'clock and&mdash;I believe
that's about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And there were two other officers there, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us what their names were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. One of them was Welcome Barnett and the other boy was named
Smith too, but I don't recall his initials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you station yourself and what did you do from the
time you arrived until the time the motorcade began to approach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I said approximately&mdash;oh, 30 to 40 feet south of the south curb of
Elm Street at the east curb of Houston. I stood around there and talked with
some of the people in this general vicinity and watched the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You stood across the street on Houston Street from the Texas
School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Cater-cornered&mdash;and I show you Commission Exhibit No. 354,
and it has a letter "A" marked there, and that will be approximately where you
were standing; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That's about where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do from the time you stationed yourself in that
position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, I stood there and talked some to the crowd after they finally
formed. They didn't start forming until around 11 o'clock, and looked over
here at the Texas School Book Depository Building and just stood there mainly&mdash;there
wasn't much to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you look up at the buildings that were around this intersection
here at Elm Street at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As you were standing there at position "A" in Exhibit No. 354,
you were in a position to observe the south windows of the Texas School Book
Depository Building, were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you notice any windows open up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I don't recall at this time whether there was any open. I'm sure
there were, but I just don't remember it specifically&mdash;any specifically being open.
There's quite a few people looking out the windows and what not of the various
buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you see any suspicious activities of any kind in any of those
windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What happened when the motorcade came down Main Street
and turned right on Houston Street; what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I just stood parade rest there, you know, trying to keep the people
back. I was facing the motorcade&mdash;they had come out in the street here a little
bit and I just stood there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you were facing west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not go out into the intersection at any point here and
help hold traffic back at that intersection, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you stood there as the motorcade went by, facing west down
toward the triple underpass and the motorcade turned left and started to go
down Elm Street, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From where you are standing, could you observe the railroad
tracks that went over the triple underpass down there at the bottom of Exhibit
No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I'm sure I could see them from that location, but I don't remember,
you know, noticing them. I had noticed them earlier in the day, probably from
that location, and I had saw some officers up there, and other than that, I don't
remember seeing anything else. I do specifically remember seeing some officers
on the overpass here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As the motorcade turned and went down Elm Street, what
happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I heard three shots, I guess they were shots. I thought that the
first two were just firecrackers and kept my position and after the third one, I
ran down the street here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You ran down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, ran down Houston Street and then to Elm, and actually, I
guess it was a little bit farther over than this, because after they turned the
corner I couldn't see any of the cars, there were so many people standing there
around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you were a little bit farther south down Elm Street than
Position "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; possibly a little bit farther south than that&mdash;yes; I was
under these windows here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's the county building there you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; a little bit farther down. Anyhow, I couldn't see down there
without running over here, and I run down here at the time to see the Presidential
car go under the triple underpass at a high rate of speed, and I pulled
my pistol out and there was people laying down there and run down the street
and that was about all. I thought when it came to my mind that there were
shots, and I was pretty sure there were when I saw his car because they were
leaving in such a hurry, I thought they were coming from this area here, and
I ran over there and checked back of it and, of course, there wasn't anything
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You thought the shot came from this little concrete structure
up behind No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On Commission Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Toward the railroad tracks there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And to the north of No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you ran down in there and what did you do when you got
down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I ran down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Down on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. And I ran up to here and I couldn't get over so I went back
around then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You went farther down Elm Street and right behind this concrete
structure here; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. And on back into there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And into the parking area behind the concrete structure there
at No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, and there's where I stayed for an hour or so and after I got
around there, they started checking everybody that was going in and out of
the&mdash;well, I don't know who they was checking because there was so much
milling around, because there was a bunch of county officers back there plus
the policemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That area was fairly searched by the officers that came down
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't find anything down there that seemed to have
anything to do with the shot that you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you sure you heard three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any idea where they came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir&mdash;like I said&mdash;the first two were just&mdash;I mulled it over
in my mind and I thought it was firecrackers and I thought to myself that was
awful&mdash;not very nice&mdash;throwing them out there, and then it dawned on me that
it wasn't and that these were shots, especially after I ran to the corner, and
this was after the third shot was fired that I got to the corner, and all I saw was
the Presidential car going under the underpass, but there were definitely three
of those shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do after you left the general area marked "C"
here, on Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, of course, you see we checked all these cars&mdash;this extends
for some distance over to the north and I went all the way down the railroad
tracks a long ways and turned around and came back and took a position right
down here where No. 1 is now&mdash;this was about an hour or an hour and a half
after the thing happened, and I don't guess it was that long, because they had
just got the word&mdash;I had already gotten back around here when Officer Tippit
was shot and we got the word over the police radio, and they took off and I
stayed in this area for quite some time around the front, working traffic, and I
don't remember when I really left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, after you searched behind the north and west of the School
Book Depository Building, you came back up to position No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You then remained in the general area of the School Book Depository
Building for some period, and then you were relieved from duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Well, I went back to work again on my regular duty. I had been
working evenings, and I had to report to work&mdash;it was 6 o'clock, I think, and
after that I went directly to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't see anybody or anything that you could associate with
the shots or with the assassination itself other than you have already described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir; I have thought about it many times. I didn't see any
smoke or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And at no time did you see any activity down on the railroad
tracks that you associated with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is what you heard that day consistent with the proposition that
the shots came from the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. They could have come from there and they could not&mdash;I just don't
know. Where I was standing it just sounded like it was all round there. When
I first thought&mdash;I don't know whether it actually came from here or not&mdash;you
know, the thoughts of sounds coming&mdash;I don't know whether they were coming
from here or not&mdash;it just looked like this was a good place for them to come
from and I guess that's the reason I ran down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Down around No. 7 pointed out on this Exhibit No. 354?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Yes; I have no earthly idea where they actually came from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate your coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. That's okay.</p>

called&mdash;she called me and told me that she made an appointment for me and
that's about all that I know, Mr. Liebeler. The other proceedings&mdash;I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I assume that you are willing to go ahead with your testimony

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Home address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. 3909 Marquette.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. In Dallas&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you in business here in Dallas, Mr. Zapruder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What business are you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Manufacturing ladies dresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The manufacture of ladies dresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I understand that you took some motion pictures at the time
of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you tell us about the circumstances under which you did
that, where you were at the time and what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And what you saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, of course, what I saw you have on film, but that was
the day, November 22, it was around 11:30. In fact, I didn't have my camera
but my secretary asked me why I don't have it and I told her I wouldn't have
a chance even to see the President and somehow she urged me and I went home
and got my camera and came back and first I thought I might take pictures
from the window because my building is right next to the building where the
alleged assassin was, and it's just across&mdash;501 Elm Street, but I figured&mdash;I may
go down and get better pictures, and I walked down, I believe it was Elm
Street and on down to the lower part, closer to the underpass and I was trying
to pick a space from where to take those pictures and I tried one place and it
was on a narrow ledge and I couldn't balance myself very much. I tried another
place and that had some obstruction of signs or whatever it was there and
finally I found a place farther down near the underpass that was a square of
concrete&mdash;I don't know what you call it&mdash;maybe about 4 feet high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you a picture that has been marked Hudson Exhibit No.
1 and ask you if you can in fact see yourself in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Let me see&mdash;there it is here. That's me standing there&mdash;there's
a girl&mdash;that's where I was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are pointing out a concrete abutment that comes up immediately
to the right of the sign that reads "Stemmons Freeway, Keep Right"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's right. That's the girl behind me&mdash;that's my girl that
works in my office. She was up there, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you and this girl are shown standing on top of this concrete
abutment there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's right&mdash;she was right behind me and that's from where I
took the pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then, you can actually see yourself in this picture, can't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, I can't distinguish myself being&mdash;I know I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recognize that this picture was taken at the time you
were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; I was there and I would say this couldn't be anybody else,
unless&mdash;if this is an authentic photograph and it isn't composed now or
changed&mdash;I would say that's me. That's the first time I have seen that.
Were these pictures ever published in a magazine&mdash;there were pictures like
that I suppose&mdash;actually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This picture here is in fact one of a series of pictures that is
being sold down here in Dallas by a fellow named Willis, I believe his name is
Phil Willis. He has a series of slides that are available and it's picture No. 5
of those slides in which you can see yourself back there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That must be it because there's another couple back there&mdash;I
took some from there and I was shooting some of the pictures to start my roll
from the beginning. I didn't want to have a blank and I shot some, in fact,
they have it&mdash;the Federal Bureau of Investigation have those pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As you stood there on this abutment with your camera, the
motorcade came down Houston Street and turned left on Elm Street, did it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And it proceeded then down Elm Street toward the triple
underpass; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's correct. I started shooting&mdash;when the motorcade started
coming in, I believe I started and wanted to get it coming in from Houston
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us what happened as you took the pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, as the car came in line almost&mdash;I believe it was almost in
line&mdash;I was standing up here and I was shooting through a telephoto lens,
which is a zoom lens and as it reached about&mdash;I imagine it was around here&mdash;I
heard the first shot and I saw the President lean over and grab himself like
this (holding his left chest area).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Grab himself on the front of his chest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Right&mdash;something like that. In other words, he was sitting like
this and waving and then after the shot he just went like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was sitting upright in the car and you heard the shot and
you saw the President slump over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Leaning&mdash;leaning toward the side of Jacqueline. For a moment
I thought it was, you know, like you say, "Oh, he got me," when you hear a
shot&mdash;you've heard these expressions and then I saw&mdash;I don't believe the President
is going to make jokes like this, but before I had a chance to organize my
mind, I heard a second shot and then I saw his head opened up and the blood
and everything came out and I started&mdash;I can hardly talk about it [the witness
crying].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's all right, Mr. Zapruder, would you like a drink of water?
Why don't you step out and have a drink of water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I'm sorry&mdash;I'm ashamed of myself really, but I couldn't help it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Nobody should ever be ashamed of feeling that way, Mr. Zapruder.
I feel the same way myself. It was a terrible thing.</p>

<p>Let me go back now for just a moment and ask you how many shots you
heard altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I thought I heard two, it could be three, because to my estimation
I thought he was hit on the second&mdash;I really don't know. The whole
thing that has been transpiring&mdash;it was very upsetting and as you see&mdash;I got a
little better all the time and this came up again and it to me looked like the
second shot, but I don't know. I never even heard a third shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't hear any shot after you saw him hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I heard the second&mdash;after the first shot&mdash;I saw him leaning
over and after the second shot&mdash;it's possible after what I saw, you know, then I
started yelling, "They killed him, they killed him," and I just felt that somebody
had ganged up on him and I was still shooting the pictures until he got
under the underpass&mdash;I don't even know how I did it. And then, I didn't even
remember how I got down from that abutment there, but there I was, I guess,
and I was walking toward&mdash;back toward my office and screaming, "They killed
him, they killed him," and the people that I met on the way didn't even know
what happened and they kept yelling, "What happened, what happened, what
happened?" It seemed that they had heard a shot but they didn't know exactly
what had happened as the car sped away, and I kept on just yelling, "They
killed him, they killed him, they killed him," and finally got to my office and my
secretary&mdash;I told her to call the police or the Secret Service&mdash;I don't know what
she was doing, and that's about all. I was very much upset. Naturally, I
couldn't imagine such a thing being done. I just went to my desk and stopped
there until the police came and then we were required to get a place to develop
the films. I knew I had something, I figured it might be of some help&mdash;I didn't
know what.</p>

<p>As to what happened&mdash;I remember the police were running behind me. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
were police running right behind me. Of course, they didn't realize yet, I
guess, where the shot came from&mdash;that it came from that height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As you were standing on this abutment facing Elm street, you
say the police ran over behind the concrete structure behind you and down the
railroad track behind that, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. After the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes&mdash;after the shots&mdash;yes, some of them were motorcycle cops&mdash;I
guess they left their motorcycles running and they were running right behind
me, of course, in the line of the shooting. I guess they thought it came from
right behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any impression as to the direction from which
these shots came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. No, I also thought it came from back of me. Of course, you
can't tell when something is in line&mdash;it could come from anywhere, but being
I was here and he was hit on this line and he was hit right in the head&mdash;I saw
it right around here, so it looked like it came from here and it could come from
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All right, as you stood here on the abutment and looked down
into Elm Street, you saw the President hit on the right side of the head and you
thought perhaps the shots had come from behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From the direction behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes, actually&mdash;I couldn't say what I thought at the moment,
where they came from&mdash;after the impact of the tragedy was really what I saw
and I started and I said&mdash;yelling, "They've killed him"&mdash;I assumed that they
came from there, because as the police started running back of me, it looked like
it came from the back of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't form any opinion at that time as to what direction
the shots did come from actually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you indicated that they could have come also from behind
or from any other direction except perhaps from the left, because they could
have been from behind or even from the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, it could have been&mdash;in other words if you have a point&mdash;you
could hit a point from any place, as far as that's concerned. I have no way
of determining what direction the bullet was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any opinion about the direction from which the
shots came by the sound, or were you just upset by the thing you had seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. No, there was too much reverberation. There was an echo
which gave me a sound all over. In other words that square is kind of&mdash;it had
a sound all over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And with the buildings around there, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes, the reverberation was such that a sound&mdash;as it would
vibrate&mdash;it didn't vibrate so much but as to whether it was a backfire&mdash;in other
words, I didn't from the first sound, from him leaning over&mdash;I couldn't think
it was a shot, but of course, the second&mdash;I think it was the second shot. I don't
know whether they proved anything&mdash;they claim he was hit&mdash;that the first
bullet went through him and hit Connally or something like that&mdash;I don't know
how that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, there are many different theories about that. One thing
I would like you to do now&mdash;we have a series&mdash;a little book here that is Commission
Exhibit No. 885 and it consists of a number of frames from motion pictures
and I want to show you certain numbers of them which are important to our
work and ask you if those look like they were taken from your film and if in
fact you could recognize it as you look through this book that these are individual
frame-by-frame pictures of the pictures that you took.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes, they are frame by frame and they weren't very clear, for
the simple reason that on the telephoto lens it's good to take stills&mdash;when you
move&mdash;did you ever have binoculars and every time you move everything is
exaggerated in the move&mdash;that's one reason why they are kind of blurred&mdash;the
movement. Now, you want me to identify whether these are my pictures?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, specifically, I first call your attention to No. 185. This is
No. 185 on the back of it and will you look at the whole book and identify it
if you can and tell us that those are the pictures that&mdash;that those appear to
be the pictures or copies of the pictures that you took from your motion picture
camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, I would say this, they look like&mdash;if they were taken from
the film I had&mdash;these are the ones. I mean, I don't know how to express myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, it looks like them&mdash;that's when they turned in from Elm
Street. Is that it? I'm trying to visualize it. This is taking it from the
opposite side of me, is it, where I would have been taking it, because I see this
structure&mdash;I have been around there and&mdash;or these&mdash;this couldn't be here&mdash;where
did they get this in there&mdash;how did they get this in there, if I was taking
the pictures where did they get this in there? That shouldn't be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is the thing back up behind on Dealy Plaza, I think, isn't
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. They have one there, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, I think there is. Now, if you will look at Hudson Exhibit
No. 1, you will see that there is some kind of concrete structure there and is
a different kind from that figure. It has bigger holes in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's right&mdash;in the back of this here, that's where it is&mdash;that's
what I thought it was&mdash;that's where I got mixed up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You thought that the concrete latticework on the individual
pictures in Commission Exhibit No. <span class="locked">885&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Now I see it&mdash;that's where they have moved now the flowers
and all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes&mdash;I have to state this for the record&mdash;so they can understand
what we are talking about&mdash;you confused it with the concrete lattice
work shown in the background in the individual photographs in Commission
Exhibit No. 885, with the larger and obviously different concrete structure in
the background of Hudson Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes, that&mdash;there is Elm Street there&mdash;this is a corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, specifically here&mdash;let me show you the ones that have
been numbered 185 and 186 and see if you can recognize those. This is 185 here
that we are looking at now&mdash;of Commission Exhibit No. 885.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes. This is where he came in from Houston Street and turned
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; and they are going down Elm Street now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; this is before&mdash;this shouldn't be there&mdash;the shot wasn't
fired, was it? You can't tell from here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. (no response).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I believe it was closer down here where it happened. Of
course, on the film they could see better but you take an 8 millimeter and you
enlarge it in color or in black and white, you lose a lot of detail. I wish I had
an enlarger here for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In any event, frame No. 185 does look like it's one of the frames,
sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And 186 is similar also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, I've got a list of them here that I want to ask you about&mdash;picture
207 and turn on over to this picture. It appears that a sign starts
to come in the picture&mdash;there was a sign in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; there were signs there also and trees and somehow&mdash;I
told them I was going to get the whole view and I must have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But the sign was in the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; but I must have neglected one part&mdash;I know what has
happened&mdash;I think this was after that happened&mdash;something had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember when you looked at your pictures yourself,
do you remember that there was a sign that does appear between the camera
and the motorcade itself and you can see the motorcade for a while and the
sign comes in the view?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the motorcade comes behind it. Now, what about picture
No. 210&mdash;however&mdash;there is no No. 210 in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about No. 222? Now, in No. 222 you can see the President's
car coming out from behind the sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you can see Governor Connally right there in that center
seat, I believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; Governor Connally&mdash;yes&mdash;these are all the same pictures&mdash;I
remember the car was kind of buried and I was kind of low and I don't
know how I got that view&mdash;I didn't get just the full view of the shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's turn to 225 and there the car is coming further out from
behind the sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that still the same part of the sequence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You can now see the President for the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; that's the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The President appears to have his hand up by his throat as he
is just coming from behind the sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; it looks like he was hit&mdash;it seems&mdash;there&mdash;somewhere
behind the sign. You see, he is still sitting upright.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; he's sitting up and holding his hand up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Do we have the sequence&mdash;the next frames?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; it will be No. 227 and his hand comes up even more and
he starts to move a little to his left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Apparently. And they started speeding the car then to&mdash;but
he is still sitting up here. Is that still the President here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; in picture No. 228&mdash;he still appears to have his hand up
and in No. 229 it's even more pronounced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As the car keeps coming up from behind and in picture 230 he has
raised both hands up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. It looks to me like he went like this&mdash;did he go to his throat&mdash;I
don't remember&mdash;I thought he went like this [holding both hands on the left
side of his chest]. Did it show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's turn over to picture 231 here&mdash;these still appear to be the
same sequence of pictures, do they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; you get about 16 per second and I think my camera was
moving a little fast, maybe 18 frames per second, you see, we have a lot of
pictures on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And 235 is there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; we've got that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In 235 both hands are up by his throat there or up to the top
of his chest and Mrs. Kennedy is looking at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. To me it looks like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mean it looks to you as though he moved a little more
sharply perhaps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Toward her&mdash;there are so many frames, of course, this is
probably his first reaction, but he leaned over&mdash;it would be after the shot was
fired, after I heard a sound, he went like this [leaning to the left and holding
both hands to the left side of his chest].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He moved over to his left and pulled his hands there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; he moved to the left and pulled his hands somewhat in
this direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Does picture 235 appear to be one of the pictures that was taken
from your sequence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about 240&mdash;let's turn over to 240 and there he has turned
his head toward the left a little bit more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. There's only about 100 frames&mdash;they are so close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Five frames?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Five frames is nothing&mdash;I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How about 249?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. No. 249&mdash;I just wonder if it was the motion that he went back
with that I don't remember&mdash;it looks like he has got his hand on his head&mdash;I
don't remember seeing that. Of course, the pictures would show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; when you pick one of them out it's hard to break it down
and pick them out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; it's hard. We run them in single frames&mdash;and to get
the main shot&mdash;it's hard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, let's turn over to picture 255&mdash;these all do look like they
are from your film?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; they are&mdash;I know this&mdash;I have seen it so many times.
In fact, I used to have nightmares. The thing would come every night&mdash;I wake
up and see this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about 255&mdash;what about that one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's still the same series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's still the same series&mdash;they keep moving along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And let's look at No. 213&mdash;as we go along here&mdash;then he does
start moving sharply to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; when you take it frame by frame, it could have been just
2 or 3 seconds, but the impression was that he was leaning over and not just
sitting there and looking over that and grabbing himself at the left side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; moving toward Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's what impressed me. Now, what number are you on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 313&mdash;you remember that one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That was&mdash;that was the horrible one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It appears to you then, that this book of pictures here as you
look through it, are your pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, Mr. Zapruder, after you had the film developed I understand
Mr. Sorrels from the Secret Service came over and helped you get the
films developed and you gave two copies of your films to Mr. Sorrels, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes. One we have sent to Washington the same night and one
went over for the viewers of the FBI on Ervay Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. The Secret Service&mdash;I brought one roll there and they told
me to dispatch it by Army plane or I don't know what they had done with it
but it was supposed to have gone to Washington and one of them, I believe,
remained here with Mr. Sorrels. He came to my office quite a few times to
show them to different people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, I understand that you, yourself, retained the original
film?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. No; I don't have that at all&mdash;I don't have any at all. They
were sold to Time and Life magazines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You sold that to Life magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Commission is interested in one aspect of this and I
would like to ask you if you would mind telling us how much they paid you
for that film.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. For the film?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, I just wonder whether I should answer it or not because
it involves a lot of things and it's not one price&mdash;it's a question of how they are
going to use it, are they going to use it or are they not going to use it, so I will
say I really don't know how to answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, I am not going to even urge you to answer the question.
We will ask it and if you would rather not answer it&mdash;the Commission feels
it would be helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I received $25,000, as you know, and I have given that to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
Firemen's and Policemen's Benevolence with a suggestion for Mrs. Tippit.
You know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't know that&mdash;you received $25,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. $25,000 was paid and I have given it to the Firemen's and
Policemen's Fund.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You gave the whole $25,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes. This was all over the world. I got letters from all over
the world and newspapers&mdash;I mean letters from all over the world. It was all
over the world&mdash;I am surprised&mdash;that you don't know it&mdash;I don't like to talk
about it too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We appreciate your answer very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I haven't done anything, the way I have given it, at a time
like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to tell you, you may not be aware of it yourself, but I
want to tell you that your film has been one of the most helpful things to the
work of the Commission that we could possibly have had because it has enabled
us to study the various positions of the people in the car and to determine by
comparing it with the reenactment&mdash;by comparing it to the view from the
window of the building, to develop with a fair degree of accuracy the facts here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I understand&mdash;and I am willing to be helpful but I am sorry
it had to be on an occasion like this. I am willing to be helpful but I wish this
would never have happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I know they have taken my camera to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was a Bell &amp; Howell camera, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you turned it over to the FBI and they have made tests on
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Yes; and then Bell &amp; Howell wanted it for their archives and
I thought they were through with it and let them have it. In return, they gave
me, not for my personal use, but a sound projector which was given to the
Golden Age Group. It's a place where old folks have a home. I asked them
to donate something. I didn't want the camera. I didn't want anything for
myself. Then the FBI wanted the camera again and I referred them to the
Bell &amp; Howell people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; the FBI asked for the camera back because the Commission
wanted to determine whether there was any difference in the frame speed
as the camera unwound itself, as it went along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, they claimed they told me it was about 2 frames fast&mdash;instead
of 16 it was 18 frames and they told me it was about 2 frames fast in
the speed and they told me that the time between the 2 rapid shots, as I understand,
that was determined&mdash;the length of time it took to the second one and
that they were very fast and they claim it has proven it could be done by 1 man.
You know there was indication there were two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your films were extremely helpful to the work of the Commission,
Mr. Zapruder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. I am only sorry I broke down&mdash;I didn't know I was going to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Zapruder, I want to thank you very much, for the Commission,
for coming down. It has been very helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Well, I am ashamed of myself. I didn't know I was going
to break down and for a man to&mdash;but it was a tragic thing, and when you
started asking me that, and I saw the thing all over again, and it was an awful
thing&mdash;I know very few people who had seen it like that&mdash;it was an awful
thing and I loved the President, and to see that happen before my eyes&mdash;his
head just opened up and shot down like a dog&mdash;it leaves a very, very deep
sentimental impression with you; it's terrible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, you don't have to feel ashamed about that at all, and
thank you very much. I enjoyed meeting you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. All right, any time you want some more help you can call on
me and I will be glad to come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. All right, thank you a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Zapruder</span>. Goodbye.</p>

<h2 id="t577">TESTIMONY OF PERDUE WILLIAM LAWRENCE</h2>

<p>The testimony of Perdue William Lawrence was taken at 9:15 p.m., on July 24,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas. Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. My name is Burt Griffin, and I am a member of the general
counsel's staff of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy, and the Commission has been set up by Executive order of President
Johnson and a joint resolution of Congress. These two official acts have
directed the Commission to investigate into the assassination of President Kennedy
and the death of Lee Harvey Oswald, to evaluate all the facts we find
and report back to President Johnson upon them. We have asked you to come
here in particular this evening, Captain Lawrence, because we are interested
in the security precautions that were taken both in connection with the protection
of President Kennedy and in the prospective transfer of Lee Harvey
Oswald to the county jail. I might say that there are a set of rules and regulations
that have been promulgated by the Commission and under these rules
and regulations I have been designated to take your deposition. You are entitled
to receive a written notice 3 days in advance from the Commission. It
has been the practice with all of the police officers who have testified that we
have simply written a letter to Chief Curry and he has been good enough to
make you people available. I assume that you haven't received proper notice,
and I will ask you at this time if you are willing to waive that notice?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Since you are willing to waive the notice, if you will raise your
right hand I will administer the oath to you. Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Not my initials&mdash;my full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your full name.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Perdue [spelling]. P-e-r-d-u-e William Lawrence [spelling],
L-a-w-r-e-n-c-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Lawrence?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. 1623 South Clinton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. In August&mdash;1911&mdash;August 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you employed with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what is your rank?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Captain of police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long have you been with the police department?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Nineteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you captain of police on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in charge of any particular department?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Traffic at this particular time. I am in charge of the
accident prevention bureau of the Dallas Police Department, but my specific
assignment was traffic control for the Presidential motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this a special 1-day assignment that you had?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Well, in this particular case&mdash;it was for this particular
occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any other person in the department who regularly
was concerned with what you call traffic control?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; Capt. R.&nbsp;A. Thompson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any reason why you handled the traffic control responsibilities
for the Presidential motorcade rather than Captain Thompson?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. None that I know of; none that I can think of except that
Chief Batchelor saw me and said, "I want you to get together with Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
Southard." Lieutenant Southard works for Captain Thompson and we were to
use my motorcycle officers and his corner men, so, because of the motorcade part
of it, I assume that this was the reason that it was turned over to me. Normally
on parade or a special assignment and such, this is under the jurisdiction
of Captain Thompson, but because of the escort part of it, I am assuming that
this was why it was given to me. I would like to also add that Captain Thompson
and I work evenings on alternate Friday and Saturday nights, and I was
scheduled to work daytime hours on Friday, November 22, and this may also be
a reason I was given this particular assignment. Captain Thompson did work
evenings on Friday, November 22, 1963, and Saturday, November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you participated in other traffic control projects in the past?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you ever been involved in one that involved the President
of the United States or any other important official who required special
protection?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In your experience in the Dallas Police Department, had there
ever been a time when there had been a President or an important person who
had come through who required special protection?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; but not in which I was directly assigned to any
duties. When President Kennedy came to town to visit Mr. Rayburn at Baylor
Hospital, Lieutenant Curtis was in charge of that detail and I don't know if I
was on a day off or what it was, but I was not in charge of that detail at all.
I made none of those arrangements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From whom did you receive your instructions in connection
with the duties that you were to carry out?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. My immediate superior was Deputy Chief R.&nbsp;H. Lunday,
and I received my instructions from Chief Lunday and Asst. Chief Batchelor;
both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you first told that you were to be in charge of this
traffic control?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. The first day was on a Tuesday&mdash;November 19.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who told you at that time?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Chief Batchelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what did Chief Batchelor tell you at that time that your
responsibilities would be?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. He told me he wanted me to go over this route and to start
working with the assignments of men to the intersections on the motorcade route,
and he said that he had gone over this route and handed me a list of intersections
that he wanted covered and the amount of men he wanted on each intersection
and the reason he wanted more than one or two at certain intersections was
because of the turning movements of the motorcade, but he also wanted assignments
made to certain overpasses and told me the number of men that he would
like to have stationed on the overpasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you the names of the particular men he wanted on the
overpass?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. He gave me the names of no men. He told me to make the
assignments, and when he handed me this list, he was either with Chief Lunday
or I went immediately to Chief Lunday and asked for the assistance of Lt. W.&nbsp;F.
Southard because he&mdash;his men would be directly involved also in these assignments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I notice you have a list in your hand. Is that the list Chief
Batchelor gave you?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. That's the list that Chief Batchelor gave me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mind if we marked this and returned this for our file?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; not a bit. I would like to add that it was not requested
that I bring any papers with me. I did bring with me some original personnel
assignment notes for the purpose of refreshing my memory, and I see no reason
why my superiors would object to any requests made by this Committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me now turn this over and I will state for the record that it
consists of five small white sheets of paper, roughly 2½ by 5 inches in size, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
there are a number of handwritten notations on it and I'm going to mark this on
the back.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I believe this to be the handwriting of Chief Batchelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I'm going to mark this Capt. P.&nbsp;W. Lawrence Deposition, July 24,
1964, Exhibit No. 1. In handing this memo to you, did Chief Batchelor say anything
to you about what the men on the overpass were supposed to do?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. He was stationing the men on the overpass to see that no
one else came onto the overpass so that no one would be over the motorcade when
the President passed under it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than stationing people at intersections, were you given any
instructions as to stationing men in between blocks?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after the 18th of November did you later receive further
instructions from your superiors?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you next receive instructions?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I next received instructions well, during the week we discussed
this with Chief Lunday and Assistant Chief Batchelor&mdash;certain assignments
as far as the motorcycle escorts were concerned, and not directly at that
time regarding stationing of any men on any particular corner.</p>

<p>I might add that when Lieutenant Southard and I went over this route, we
found one intersection open and which was on Record Street, which raised our
total&mdash;this is my writing here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, this is at the bottom of the second page and you have written
in the word "Record."</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. That's right&mdash;that's my handwriting and during that week
I was next told, of course, to contact other people regarding the route connected
with the motorcade to see that no trains would be coming across at the time that
the Presidential motorcade was passing through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. These were grade crossings that you are talking about?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Grade crossing&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time of your first meeting with Chief Batchelor were you
given any special instructions about the protection of the President?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the next time you received some instructions from one
of your superiors?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. The next time was, to the best of my knowledge, the motorcade
assignments&mdash;possibly 2 days before the President arrived&mdash;I asked how we
would escort this motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And with whom did you discuss that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Chief Lunday and Chief Batchelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody from the Secret Service present at that time?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Not at that time&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were you told about the purpose of the officers that were
being provided, if anything?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I was told that there would be these lead motorcycle officers,
and that we would also have these other officers alongside the President's
car and the Vice President's car, and some of the others that would be in the
motorcade, and approximately how many officers would be needed for the
escort, and at that time I had prepared a list of 18 solo motorcycle officers,
this included three solo sergeants.</p>

<p>I was also instructed that about this motorcade&mdash;that when it reached Stemmons
Expressway, Chief Batchelor told me that he wanted a solo motorcycle
officer in each traffic lane, each of the five traffic lanes waiting for the motorcade,
so that no vehicles, on Stemmons Expressway would pass the motorcade at all
and he wanted these solo motorcycle officers to pull away from the escort and
get up there on Stemmons Freeway and block the traffic, and some of these
officers, he stated, would pull past the Presidential car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would this include blocking oncoming traffic?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. This would stop all oncoming traffic on Stemmons Freeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All the way to the Trade Mart?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No, sir&mdash;this would stop all traffic that would be northbound
on Stemmons, on&mdash;all northbound traffic on Stemmons Expressway, in
the five lanes of traffic, so when the motorcade came onto the freeway, that
no cars would be able to pass it, that the motorcycle officers would stop the
traffic, and then the motorcycle officers after all the motorcade was headed for
the Trade Mart, that then these motorcycle officers would slowly move up, but
they would keep all the traffic behind&mdash;all the northbound traffic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But, the southbound traffic would be permitted to run in the
southbound lanes?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did that conversation take place?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. That conversation took place about the 20th of November&mdash;2
days before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you receive another set of instructions or orders after
that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; on the evening of November 21, this was the first
time that I had attended any security meeting at all in regards to this motorcade.
At approximately 5 p.m. I was told to report to the conference room
on the third floor, and when I arrived at the conference room the deputy chiefs
were in there, there were members of the Secret Service&mdash;Mr. Sorrels, Captain
Gannaway, Captain Souter of radio patrol, and Capt. Glen King, deputy chiefs,
assistant chiefs, and Chief Curry, and one gentleman, who I assume was in
charge of the security for the Secret Service. This was the first time I had
attended any conferences in regard to the security of this escort, and I listened
in on most of the discussion and I heard one of the Secret Service men say that
President Kennedy did not desire any motorcycle officer directly on each side of
him, between him and the crowd, but he would want the officers to the rear.
This conversation I overheard as Chief Batchelor was using a blackboard
showing how he planned to handle this&mdash;how plans had been made to cover
the escort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anything said in that meeting about any special precautions
that should be taken in connection with protecting the President?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; there was some discussion that centered more around
the security down at the Trade Mart than any other place and Captain
Gannaway was in charge of the security in that area, and then chief Stevenson,
I believe, was there, and they mentioned that they would have detectives
stationed along the route&mdash;along the motorcade route, especially in the downtown
area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what were they to be looking for?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. They were taking care of security, all right, but they did
not go into any discussion in my presence. I assume that this had all been,
discussed earlier, in fact, when I was called up there, these people were already
meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever receive any instructions as to what the men were
to do whom you stationed at the various intersections and elsewhere along
the route?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; I discussed this with Chief Lunday two or three
times and Chief Batchelor two or three times before this meeting ever took
place and we discussed the fact that maybe some demonstrators with placards
might show up and that the officers stationed along the route should be instructed
to be on the alert for any persons that might throw anything or make
any movement that might endanger the President at all, and if there were
any incident of that nature, that the person would be arrested immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any discussion between you and your superior officers
about watching the buildings and windows in the buildings or the tops of the
buildings?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No, no instructions were given to me about my men
watching the buildings&mdash;no, so, mine were more crowd control instructions&mdash;to
watch the crowds, to keep them back, and to block off the traffic and to block
off the streets on the approach of the motorcade and not to let them by&mdash;and to
keep the crowds back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there other men who were going to have other responsibilities?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes, it was my understanding that the other responsibilities
in regard to security were to be handled by the special service bureau
and the members of the criminal investigation division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were they going to be stationed along the routes?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. It was my understanding that they would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you ever informed as to how many men would be in each
particular location?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With specific reference to Dealey Plaza and the area of Elm and
Houston and the School Book Depository, did you have any idea of how many
Secret Service or detective bureau people or CID people would be in that
area?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever receive any advice or instructions from any member
of the Secret Service about watching buildings or performing other functions
other than the normal crowd controls which you have just mentioned?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you met with the Secret Service, what do you recall that
the Secret Service did discuss?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I sat in on the discussion and I did not participate in
any at all, and from what I heard there would be sufficient personnel inside the
Trade Mart&mdash;they were discussing this, and these detectives' assignments were
not the ones that I was at that time primarily instructed in, so&mdash;I know that
they had made some elaborate precautions, which no one discussed with me,
but I don't remember all of the conversation that went on regarding that. I
was particularly interested in traffic assignments and these were the ones that
I was listening for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there ever any discussion that you heard about taking
precautions designed to prevent some sort of assault on the President that would
be more severe than simply placards, picketing, and people throwing rotten
eggs and vegetables, and things like that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Not to my knowledge, other than the fact that the Secret
Service man in there&mdash;when it was mentioned about these motorcycle officers
alongside the President's car, he said, "No, these officers should be back and
if any people started a rush toward the car, if there was any movement at all
where the President was endangered in any way, these officers would be in a
position to gun their motors and get between them and the Presidential car,"
and he mentioned, of course, the security and safety of the President and those
words were mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But was that concept of the security and the safety of the
President spelled out in any certain details?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Not to my knowledge. Now, you see, I'm not familiar
with some of the things that were discussed with the other bureau commanders.
Now, I didn't know until that time who was going to be in charge at the Trade
Mart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time is that that you have reference to?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Sometime between 5 and 6 p.m. on November 21. I knew
at that time that Captain Souter would be in charge, and when I was so advised,
after this meeting I asked Souter if I could meet him down at the Trade Mart,
and discuss how the motorcade would come into the Trade Mart, and they had
discussed also about keeping an area open down there and it had also been
discussed with me&mdash;I might add one thing that I had forgotten to say before&mdash;that
there would be two officers remain with the Presidential car while he was
in the Trade Mart. This was told to me by Assistant Chief Batchelor&mdash;to the
best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>After this conference, I asked Captain Souter if I could meet him down at
the Trade Mart and he said he would be down there and then I called Sgt.
S.&nbsp;Q. Bellah [spelling] B-e-l-l-a-h. I called him on the phone at home and asked
him if he could meet me down there because he was going to be the leading solo
motorcycle sergeant. He met me at the Trade Mart with Stavis Ellis, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
solo motorcycle sergeant, who was going to be leading the Presidential motorcade
and I met with both of them down there on the evening of the 21st, so that I
would know how they would come in the area and how they were to be escorted
around in the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it from what you said, that your principal concern then
was keeping the motorcade moving smoothly?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there was no special attention brought on your part to the
question of actually protecting the President other than from some impediment
to the actual movement of the automobile.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Mainly&mdash;my understanding was mainly that my assignment
was for crowd control and, of course, security would be involved in it, as
far as anyone making any movements in the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you prepare a list of the assignments that you gave in
stationing your men along the route?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I did and I might add another thing that I have overlooked
here, that Chief Batchelor had also instructed me to have one man on a
three-wheel motorcycle&mdash;to station this one man over the Stemmons overpass at
Industrial, to make sure that no car stopped and no people stopped there who
would be in a position to throw anything down when the motorcade came off of
Stemmons Freeway to make its turn onto Industrial, and there would be a three-wheeler
up there and he had specifically instructed me on that, which to me
was security as well too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you given any general instructions to go out and look
along the route for special security problems that might arise along the route?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I was not, but I did do this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do in that regard?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. This is getting ahead, but after the detail was put out in
the detail room and I had talked to the motorcycle officers and the motorcade
officers and had given them their instructions, I then went out to Love Field
with Maj. George Tropolis of the police reserves who is in charge of the police
reserves and awaited the arrival of the President and to see that all the motorcycle
officers were at the proper location, I had already given a copy of the detail
to each one of the sergeants and their instructions and when we were out
there at the airport, the weather cleared up and the officers put their raincoats,
of course, in the motorcycle saddlebags and when the Presidential plane arrived
and President Kennedy got off of the plane, I saw that there was going to be a
brief ceremony there, and I knew that Chief Lumpkin was going to&mdash;I had been
told was going to be ahead of this motorcade&mdash;I got in my car and tried to be a
few blocks ahead of him to make sure that everybody was on their assignments,
and, of course, the crowd, the huge crowd en route surprised me, especially in
the residential area, that all the people had turned out to see the President. I
didn't expect a crowd this big, and, of course, we had officers stationed at many
intersections along the route, but not at every intersection until we got to the
downtown area. Not every intersection was covered, but as I went along the
route, this didn't look like it was necessary because the crowds already had
blocked the streets, and no motor vehicle could have crossed some of these streets.
As I came up to many of these intersections&mdash;I slowed my car down and I was
in uniform, but I was driving a plain car which I drive, and I told the officers
to keep the traffic in back of me moving and not let any vehicles cross because
I could hear Chief Curry on channel 2 giving the location of the motorcade
from time to time, and I knew a few blocks ahead of him would be Chief
Lumpkin, and I knew that I would have to stay considerably ahead of him.
Although I was not given this assignment&mdash;I proceeded on this route, and I
followed it on down to the Trade Mart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's go back a little bit and let me ask you&mdash;when did you first
give instructions to the men who were actually stationed along the route as
to what they should do?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I gave them those instructions on the morning of November
22 and I had with me at the time&mdash;I had the detail with me and some notes
that I had written. I first told the men the approximate time of the arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
of the President's plane at Love Field. Then, I went over the route that the
motorcade would take to the Trade Mart and then the approximate time they
were scheduled to be at the Trade Mart and then to leave for Love Field.</p>

<p>I stated that there would be some assignments which we would call assignment
No. 1, assignment No. 2 and assignment No. 3. Some officers would only
have one assignment and some would have two and some would have three, and
that these assignments would be given to them by Lieutenant Southard, that
there would be supervisors stationed along the route, cruising the route, and
would be able to assist them. I then covered the supervisory assignments,
telling them where these sergeants would be stationed along the route, and
if anything came up they were to contact them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The men you assigned, from the instructions that you gave them,
what would you expect that these men would do besides simply keep people
from running out into the motorcade of cars?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. They are crowd control&mdash;for the motorcade to move and
I also gave the men instructions that it would be no violation&mdash;for persons to
carry placards, that we expected very little of this, but that they were to be
alert to any unusual movements in the crowd so that no one threw anything
at the President, that there would be no repetition of the Ambassador Stevenson
incident, that President Kennedy was the President of the United States and
entitled to the courtesy and protection of this office, and it was their duty to
see that this was done, and if there were any violations of the law of any type,
that they would arrest individuals immediately, and these were the specific
instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if a man, captain, one of your men was placed at a
station&mdash;was actually standing out there and acting pursuant to these orders,
first of all, let me ask you what direction would he be looking; would he be
looking toward the street or would he be turned around and facing the crowd?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. He would either be facing the crowd or facing the street,
depending on the necessity at that time. He was given no specific instructions
except that he was not told specifically that he would face the crowd on the
traffic assignments, but he was told that he was to watch the crowd, so I wouldn't
say that the man&mdash;that all of the men on the route were specifically instructed
to face the crowd. I gave them no such instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you drove down the route preceding the motorcade, did you
observe just exactly what these men were doing?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; most of the men were watching the oncoming traffic
and keeping it moving. They were keeping this oncoming traffic moving. Some
of the men were trying to push the crowd back, especially in the downtown area.
There were many of them facing the crowds there and trying to push the crowds
back, and this was, I imagine, about a mile ahead of the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As a practical matter&mdash;stationing as you did two men at each
intersection generally&mdash;could two men have effectively prevented anyone who
was bent upon attacking the President, could they have effectively prevented
him from rushing out and doing something?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. If they saw them in time, but two men, in as large a
crowd as that&mdash;these men had all they could handle, with as large a crowd
as we had turn out for that motorcade. It was a full-time job keeping the
crowd back, and this was what the officers were trying to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you given any thought, or do you have any suggestions as
to how a police department the size of the Dallas Police Department could have
stationed more men along the route so that they could have effectively&mdash;not only
kept the crowd back but could have been effectively on the lookout for people
who might want to rush out and do something?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Well, looking back on it, I would say, with the manpower
that we had for this particular job and the crowd that turned out, that without
the use of precautions, these men would have a very difficult time keeping a
crowd back like that. This crowd was an enthusiastic crowd, as you know, as
you probably have heard many times, and it was a bigger crowd than I expected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it practical for a city the size of Dallas to use barricades or
ropes along the motorcade, the length of the one that the President traveled?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Well, with the length of this motorcade, I don't believe
that we could have on this short a notice, and this is my opinion. We would
have to go to another source to get sufficient barricades to handle it, because I
don't think we have that many barricades&mdash;I don't think that many barricades
would be available for a motorcade as long as this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does the police department maintain barricades?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; the barricades are obtained from the public works department.
We have been able to request barricades to barricade off streets at
certain events on holidays and parks. We have asked for barricades and we have
always received barricades.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you give any specific instructions to your men with respect
to watching windows?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you give any specific instructions to the people who were
stationed along Elm and Houston at the intersection of Elm and Houston, the
man at Houston in particular, did you direct any particular attention to those
men who were stationed there?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I did not make the individual assignments, but as I
said, the only thing I did was make these remarks as to these particular assignments
in stating that they would be made by these officers, and, of course, there
were some assignments made in this area and there were also some assignments
made to the overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything that would be in the general orders or the
general background and training of the police officers who were stationed along
this route which would make the individual police officer believe that it was his
responsibility to watch the windows of buildings?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I don't recall any specific instructions of that kind ever
being given on an assignment of this type, because&mdash;again&mdash;as I said, with the
manpower that was assigned and the crowd they had to control, that the officer
had all he could take care of in maintaining crowd control of the people on the
streets and watching the crowd there.</p>

<p>I am talking about the men that were assigned for these specific assignments
here. I assume that some instructions have been given to some members of the
CID, the criminal investigation division, and to the men from the special service
bureau, and the men specifically assigned to security duties instead of traffic
duties. It would be my assumption that this was a part of the assignments
given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would the duties of the men at the intersections be so burdensome
prior to the time that the motorcade actually arrived that they couldn't
keep their eyes on the windows and other places such as that? In other words,
did they have anything to do of substance until shortly before the motorcade
arrived?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. They had everything they could do to take care of the
crowds when I came through there before the President's motorcade&mdash;keeping
the crowds back, in fact, when I was listening on channel 2 I heard Inspector
Sawyer asking for more help for men downtown to try to keep the crowds back
so the motorcade could get through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When an officer is at an intersection for the purpose of crowd
control, do his problems begin as soon as the crowd begins to form, regardless
of how long it is before the President is going to arrive, or does the problem
only become a substantial one when he realizes the President is 5 minutes
away?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I think when he first goes on assignment, that's when
he's prepared to handle the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, is there a danger that the crowd is going to move out into
the street at any point as soon as it gets large enough where the people start
to push and shove?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. This did happen in the downtown area and this was
substantially before the President's car actually arrived. This is why, I believe,
and I am assuming, because I was ahead of this motorcade, but I heard
Chief Curry ask these motorcycle officers that were way up ahead to drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
back, and some of them that were alongside and to the rear of the President,
to pull up alongside his car, and Chief Curry had some of these motorcycle
officers that were supposed to be about a couple of blocks ahead of this motorcade,
he asked them to drop back. He asked the lead motorcycles that were
supposed to be a half block ahead of the escort&mdash;he asked them to drop back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, is it fair to say that without specific instructions, that an
officer would not watch the windows of buildings? He would not do it as a
result of routine orders that prevail in the police department and his general
training.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I would say in a case like this that an officer should do
this and this should be part of his responsibility on the job, but I also have to
say he was not given any specific instructions to do that as far as buildings
were concerned, but I'm talking about the men assigned to this traffic assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any other specific instructions besides watching the
windows of buildings that, as a result of your experience on November 22, you
think should be given to police officers who have traffic assignments?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. As a result of what happened on November 22, I believe
that where a Head of State, the President of the United States, comes to Dallas
and is in a motorcade or a parade, that the streets should be barricaded or roped
off and that officers&mdash;more officers than were stationed be stationed along the
route to control the crowd. I mean, of course, this is looking back&mdash;as I told
you before&mdash;there were more people along the route&mdash;in fact, I was surprised&mdash;they
had even stopped their cars all along Stemmons Freeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, we are trying to benefit from hindsight, when I
asked you if in looking back you could make some suggestions for the future.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could a police force the size of the Dallas police force have
found more officers to man the route?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. With a route as long as this, I doubt that they could
have, because some of these officers were given second and third assignments
and this motorcade route, as long as it was, was in my opinion&mdash;this was too
long of a motorcade route to give the proper security, and our department
wasn't big enough to handle an event&mdash;of course, this is hindsight again&mdash;and
an event like this with a route as long as this to cover all of the cross streets,
because we certainly didn't cover all of the cross streets along the route except
the downtown area. We covered some of the main ones and there were other
streets that were not covered and the people themselves block the streets for
the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have with you here a list of the assignments you made on
November 22?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you give that to us so we can mark it for identification?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes, sir; would you mind me explaining a couple of
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; not at all, if you think it is necessary.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. There were some changes made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark this as Capt. W.&nbsp;P. Lawrence Deposition,
July 24, 1964, Exhibit No. 2. Do you want to indicate what clarification you
would make in the assignments that are shown on Exhibit No. 2?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; on the morning of November 22, the streets were
still wet and it was raining that morning and I talked to Asst. Chief Batchelor
about some of the motorcade assignments and he agreed with me that no car,
no motorcycle officer, should pass the President's car, so we reassigned some
officers indicated by asterisks on this detail to cover the Stemmons Freeway
traffic lanes to the rear of the escort to prevent any vehicles from passing the
presidental party, and that's shown on the detail. Also, as I say&mdash;you can see
the asterisks here beside these officers and they were changed. Also, I felt that
because of the curvature of Stemmons Freeway and these people coming over a
crest and around a curve&mdash;that they would be on top of these motorcycle
officers and would not have warning enough. I discussed placing a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
the three-wheel motorcycle officers up further on Stemmons Expressway,
which would be back farther south, so that when they saw from the top of
Stemmons Expressway this motorcade approaching, they could start stopping
the traffic before it came around the curve and down the hill because of the
speed. For this reason, two officers were stationed&mdash;their assignment was
changed and they were placed&mdash;they were stationed up on Stemmons Freeway
for the purpose of starting to stop this traffic themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else on there that you think should be
clarified?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; on the evening&mdash;I'm going back a day, but on the
evening of November 21, I was handed a list of additional men from the Third
Patrol Platoon to work traffic assignments. Here is the list&mdash;you can have
this list.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. This necessitated me making some changes so that the
three-wheel motorcycle officers could be taken off of corner assignments and
placed on patrol assignments in the downtown area, and those assignments, or
some of those patrol assignments are shown on the last page of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. The changes you can see were made in ink. There was
one particular assignment, on page 3, that we had eliminated because we understood
that the Highland Park Police would cover Lemmon and Loma Alto and
then when these additional men were given to us, two officers were placed back
on this assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I have marked the additional list of 19 men, which list you received
on November 22, as Capt. P.&nbsp;W. Lawrence, July 24, 1964, Exhibit No. 3.
Let me ask you some specific questions about it&mdash;about the men who were stationed
in the area of Dealey Plaza. Did you question any of these men after
the President was shot to determine whether or not they had seen anyone in
the windows of the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; however, when I questioned the men&mdash;the men had
already been&mdash;one man that I questioned had already been questioned by Mr.
Sorrels and this would be Officer J.&nbsp;E. Murphy and two other men that I questioned
were Officers J.&nbsp;W. Foster and J.&nbsp;C. White. I questioned J.&nbsp;W. Foster
regarding the men that were alongside him on the overpass, on the triple underpass
where the President was to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you question Sergeant Harkness?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I didn't question Sergeant Harkness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you question Officer King&mdash;W.&nbsp;K. King?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you question Officer J.&nbsp;B. Allen?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you question Officer W.&nbsp;H. Denham?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or Officer W.&nbsp;E. Barnett?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Officer J.&nbsp;M. Smith?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Officer E.&nbsp;L. Smith?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of anyone in the police department who questioned
those men after the assassination to determine whether or not they had been
observing the windows of the Texas School Book Depository Building and had
seen anybody in those buildings?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I know that all of these men have been questioned and
that they were calling all of these men to be questioned and that this investigation
was being handled by the Secret Service, and this is one reason why I did
not question these men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you received any information that any of these men did
see anybody at the windows of the Texas School Book Depository Building, particularly
on the sixth floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I have never received any information from any of these
men that they saw anybody up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have answered that you did not conduct an investigation of
these men and that you thought the Secret Service did; let me ask the further
question&mdash;has the police department conducted an investigation of these men who
were at the intersections of Main and Houston and Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. To my knowledge, they were&mdash;there was an investigation
requested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By the police department?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. By the police department&mdash;that reports were requested
from these men, by the supervisory officers, but&mdash;and by the inspectors and the
deputy chiefs&mdash;but I was not given any such assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me turn to the movement of Lee Harvey Oswald and ask
you when did you first receive instructions as to the moving of Lee Harvey
Oswald to the county jail?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I received no original instructions on the movement of
Lee Harvey Oswald. I was scheduled to be off on Saturday and Sunday. These
were my days off. On Saturday at approximately 10 a.m., I came down in
civilian clothes and I observed a large crowd of people around the county courthouse
and I had knowledge from what I had heard on television and I had
seen on television and heard on the radio that charges had already been filed
against Lee Harvey Oswald, so it was my assumption that he would be transferred
to the county jail, but I had no knowledge of it; and seeing this large
crowd gathering down at this part of town, I immediately called the traffic office
and started trying to contact Sergeant Harkness and finally got him down there
and told him to get some other traffic officers down there and I remained down at
this location until approximately 6:30 p.m. when Captain Thompson came on
duty. While down there and during the afternoon, I noticed there was a large
crowd gathered and there seemed to be a need for barricades or ropes or something
to keep these people behind these ropes and across the street from the
county jail, and I called Chief Batchelor's office, and Officer Art Hammett
answered the phone and I told Art Hammett there was a large crowd down there,
and this was early in the afternoon&mdash;I would say about 2 or 3 o'clock in the
afternoon on Saturday&mdash;and there was a large crowd there and I believe that
ropes or barricades were necessary to keep these people out of the streets and
across the street at Dealey Plaza, and Hammett said he would try to get in
touch with Chief Batchelor and let me know.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon I got a call on the radio, and, of course, it was a three-wheel
motorcycle with the radio going, and Officer Hammett asked me and I
am assuming he was in the dispatcher's office at the time, and he asked me if the
ropes that I requested were to block off the street for motor vehicle traffic and I
told him it was not, and he said, "Well, permission is granted." Then, we
borrowed some rope from the sheriff's office and we roped off this block across
the street from the county jail. We also got some barricades from Elm and
Houston where a&mdash;where part of the street had been blocked off there anyway,
and we blocked off the sidewalks on the county jail side&mdash;at Houston and Elm
Street, and Main Street, and the only persons we allowed in this area were
television, radio, and news media people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you take any further precautions on Sunday?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes. By the way, when Captain Thompson came on,
I contacted him by radio and asked him to meet me down there and he relieved
me and our solo motorcycle detail was placed down there in the evening.
When I got home I called Chief Lunday at home and I told him&mdash;that's when
I heard that the transfer was supposed to be made the following morning,
that there would be a need for some more men down there and that I would be
down there and I would get as many men as I could on the location. So
on Sunday morning I arrived down there and I'm going to guess at the time
as approximately 8 a.m. I first went by the office and I picked up some police
reserves in my car and took about four of them down there with me, and then
I had some motorcycle officers that were not already stationed&mdash;upstairs on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span>
the third floor&mdash;and I had them meet me down there too. It was still roped
off and the crowds started gathering and I personally instructed Sergeant
Steigel to go down there and Sergeant Bellah, and most of the men down there,
I personally instructed them that when Oswald was brought in down there,
that they were not to look at Oswald, that they were to face the crowd and
they were not to worry about anything but keeping their eyes on that crowd,
because I estimated there were approximately 500 people down there at that
time, and these officers were specifically instructed on that. And when Chief
Lunday showed up at approximately&mdash;sometime between 9:30 and 10, he showed
up&mdash;he arrived in civilian clothes&mdash;he saw that there was a large crowd there
too and we were concerned about the security of Oswald, and I expressed this
opinion to Chief Lunday and Lieutenant Southard also. There with me at
the time too was Captain Solomon, who also showed up down there. The only
time that I knew that anything had happened was when Sheriff Bill Decker
came out of his office and came by the cameras there where the vehicle was supposed
to enter the county jail entrance there, and he waved for me to come
over to him. I was across the street at that time and he told me that Oswald
had been shot in the basement of the city hall. So, after this was confirmed,
we then sent some more men to Parkland Hospital to seal it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the stationing of men along
the route that it was expected that Oswald was to follow?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever receive any specific instructions from any of your
superiors on stationing your men around Dealey Plaza or the county jail or
did the precautions that you took&mdash;were they undertaken on your own initiative?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I would say that I notified Chief Lunday of the situation
down there and then he told me to go ahead and station these men there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But there never was any independent effort made by your superior
officers to contact you prior to the move and say, "Captain Lawrence, we
are going to move Oswald at such and such a time, or in such and such a way,
and take such and such precautions"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I believe though that Chief Lunday was in communication
with headquarters because he went immediately after he talked
to Lieutenant Southard and I and saw this crowd too, he immediately went
inside the sheriff's office and it is my assumption that he had communication
with them because he came out a little later and told me about the plans&mdash;how
Oswald was to be brought down and that he would not be brought down in
the armored truck, but that the armored truck would come Elm Street and
would make a left turn off of Elm, and when it did, this car with the detectives
in it would come first and the car with Oswald would turn into the ramp there
at the county jail and they would lower the gates immediately. At that time
Chief Lunday was in charge down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long were you informed of this plan to bring Oswald in a
police car; how long before you actually knew Oswald was shot did you learn
about that plan?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I would say approximately 10 minutes&mdash;I'm just guessing&mdash;I
know it was just shortly after that that I heard he was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you ever informed that the armored car had arrived at the
police station?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. No; I had no knowledge of an armored car until Chief
Lunday told me about it and at the same time he was telling me about it, a
sergeant arrived down there from the radio patrol and was giving Chief Lunday
some information to the same effect, that the armored car was going to be used
as a decoy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But maybe I didn't make my question clear&mdash;was any information
ever passed on to the people at the county jail that the decoy car had arrived in
the city basement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Not to my knowledge. I was outside all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think we have pretty well covered everything here. I'm going
to ask you if you will sign Exhibit No. 1 and also Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. This man did not show up and he was given some other
assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the No. 3 man there on that list?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Yes; he was given some other assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me mark one more paper here&mdash;this is a copy of a letter that
you wrote.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. That's a copy of a letter that I wrote that you probably
have in the file there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is a letter you wrote to Chief Curry on July 15 detailing
what you did on November 22, and I am going to mark it Capt. P.&nbsp;W. Lawrence
Deposition, July 24, 1964, Exhibit No. 4, and I will ask you if you will sign that up
at the top also. Do you have anything else, captain, you would like to add?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Oh, I guess this probably has been mentioned to you before&mdash;there
are some people that were down there&mdash;Captain Solomon and I discussed
the fact that we were rather shocked at the crowd that was down there
when they announced that Oswald&mdash;when they heard that Oswald had been
shot&mdash;about them cheering, but this was an actual fact, and I thought it was a
terrible thing myself, it broke me up too, this killing of the President, but as I
said, this was a real shock that these people cheered like this. This just showed
the attitude of some of them that were down there. I can't think of anything
else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to thank you for coming here and taking this time. All of
the members of your department who have been here have really given very
generously of their time and cooperated and we are all very appreciative of it.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. I did learn of some new security measures from this unfortunate
experience. I refer to the manner in which the Secret Service handled
the transfer of President Johnson and his party from Parkland Hospital, the
plans for this transfer in unmarked cars, the solo escorts and positioning of the
vehicles en route to Love Field. First, the Secret Service personnel made arrangements
for three unmarked cars to be placed in a "ready" position at the rear of
Parkland without the knowledge of the news media or other persons. Three cars
were so arranged. The first car was Chief Curry's unmarked car, the second car
was my unmarked car, and the third car was Inspector Putnam's unmarked car.
I was instructed to have two solo officers ready to go but not to give them their
destination until we started to leave&mdash;these instructions were from the Secret
Service. When President Johnson came out of the hospital with his party he was
immediately taken to Chief Curry's lead vehicle. Other White House and Secret
Service personnel got in my car, as they did in Inspector Putnam's car. I instructed
the solo officers to escort us to Love Field. As we left Parkland Hospital
the solo officers started using their sirens and shortly thereafter Chief Curry
came on the police radio and requested them to cut the sirens off. Chief Curry
repeated these instructions about three or four times and after several blocks the
officers cut off their sirens. One of the Secret Service men in my vehicle instructed
me as to how to position my vehicle to the rear of Chief Curry's car
and I also noticed in the rear view mirror that Inspector Putnam's vehicle was
positioned in such a way that it would be difficult for any other car to overtake
this escort. After the solo motorcycle officers cut off their sirens they went ahead
and stopped traffic at various intersections so that it was not necessary for any
of the cars in President Johnson's party to stop. I was quite impressed with the
quick efficient planning of the Secret Service in getting the President and his
party safely to the airport and the security precautions taken while en route to
Love Field. You know&mdash;this thing&mdash;something like this, this just really hits you.
You are so busy you don't know it, but it just finally really hits you down deep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There's not very much I guess really that can be said&mdash;it's one of
these events that is so shocking in our lifetime.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Too&mdash;Chief Curry was really torn up about it&mdash;out at
Parkland Hospital he held himself real good&mdash;I guess we all were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; we all were. Thank you very much for coming.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>. Thank you.</p>
